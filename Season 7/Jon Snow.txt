 7]]=== [[Jon at a meeting at Winterfell. ]] To prepare for the forthcoming conflict with the Night King, the newly declared King Jon orders his bannermen to conscript all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 for combat training. However, he notes that having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. He also asks that all maesters should start searching for dragonglass. He stresses that dragonglass is now more valuable than gold due to the threat of the White Walkers.  When Sansa advocates that the Umbers and Karstarks be stripped of their lands and titles as punishment for supporting Ramsay, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and summons [[Ned Umber]] and [[Alys Karstark]] to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.  In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies and tells her to trust him. When Sansa reminds him that the late Joffrey did not tolerate dissent, Jon asks Sansa if she thinks he's like Joffrey. Sansa tells Jon that she knows he is nothing like Joffrey and assures Jon that he is good at leadership but she stresses that he must act wiser than Ned and Robb."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  At Winterfell, Jon, Sansa, and Davos discuss Tyrion's letter that they have received. While Sansa suspects it might be a trap, Jon doesn't think so due to Tyrion ending the letter with the line "''all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers' eyes''", which Tyrion has told Jon in their first meeting years ago. Even so, Jon agrees that now is not the right time to go to Dragonstone. Davos opines that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] will make a good ally in the war to come against the [[White Walkers]].  Later Jon receives a raven from Sam informing him of his discovery of dragonglass on Dragonstone. At another gathering of the Northern lords, Jon informs them of Sam's discovery and Daenerys's invitation telling them that he has decided to accept. Many of the Lords, including Sansa, openly disapprove, but Jon stresses that they need both the dragonglass and powerful allies like Daenerys to have any chance at defeating the Night King. He names Sansa as Regent to rule in his place until he returns. [[Jon sees through Petyr's manipulation.]] In the crypts beneath Winterfell, Jon pays respects to Ned until he is interrupted by Littlefinger. Littlefinger tries to sweet-talk Jon, but he sees through his manipulation and starts to walk away. Littlefinger informs Jon of his love for Sansa, which causes him to lose his temper and start to strangle him. Jon threatens Littlefinger saying that he will kill him if he ever touches his sister. He then leaves the crypt and gives a farewell nod to Sansa, before joining Davos on the ride to White Harbor, where they will take a ship to Dragonstone.  [[Jon and Davos arrive on Dragonstone.]] Jon and Davos arrive at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], and are immediately greeted by Tyrion and [[Missandei]]. Upon meeting, Tyrion address Jon as the bastard of Winterfell while Jon addressed him as the "dwarf" of [[Casterly Rock]]. Jon observes that Tyrion has picked up some scars. Jon also introduces Davos while Tyrion introduces Missandei, who requests that they surrender their weapons. Jon and his entourage hand over their weapons to Daenerys's [[Dothraki]] guards."[[Stormborn]]"  [[file:Walk to Dragonstone TQJ.jpg|thumb|Davos and Jon first lay eyes on Queen Daenerys Targaryen's dragons.]] On the walk to the [[Dragonstone|castle]], Missandei walks with Davos and tells him that she comes from the island of [[Naath]]. Davos remarks that it was a paradise full of palm trees. Jon and Tyrion talk about Sansa's marriage to Tyrion. Tyrion assures Jon that it was a sham and remarks that she is a lot smarter than she lets on, which Jon agrees. While Jon is aware of the fate of the previous Starks who had met with the Mad King, Jon insists that he is not a Stark. Jon and Davos are startled at the sight of [[Drogon]], [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] flying low over the causeway and dive to the ground, while an amused Missandei and Tyrion retain their composure. Offering Jon a hand up, Tyrion says he wishes he could tell Jon he'll get used to the dragons – but no one is quite used to them except their mother, who is waiting for Jon within.  [[Jon clasps eyes on the Dragon Queen.]] In the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys's many titles while Davos introduces Jon simply as King in the North. Daenerys thanks Jon for traveling so far but insists that he is a mere Lord. Davos begs to differ but Daenerys responds that there has been no King in the North ever since [[Torrhen Stark]] bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], and adds that an oath lasts for perpetuity. Daenerys then reiterates her demand for Jon to bend the knee but he refuses. When Daenerys accuses him of breaking faith with [[House Targaryen]], Jon reminds her that the Mad King burnt his grandfather and uncle.  Daenerys apologizes for her father's actions and stresses that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents. She then urges Jon to renew the historic allegiance between their two great houses. Jon expresses agreement with Daenerys's view that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents, but argues that he is not beholden to his ancestors' oaths. Jon tells her that he has come for her help. Daenerys reminds him that she has three dragons and Dothraki who have pledged themselves to her. Getting to the point of his trip, Jon likens the fighting between the Great Houses to children squabbling over a game. Jon points out that the Army of the Dead is their true enemy. Daenerys is skeptical but Tyrion vouches for Jon. Jon says that they need to make cause to fight against the Army of the Dead. [[Daenerys explains her faith in herself to Jon.]] Daenerys asks Jon if his father knew that his friend Robert had sent assassins to kill her as a baby; overlooking the fact that Eddard had opposed Robert Baratheon's assassination plot and Robert had rescinded said plot on his deathbed (though, she may be unaware of that). Daenerys recounts that she was targeted by assassins, enslaved, raped, and defiled but that her faith in herself rather the gods kept her going. Daenerys talks about the miracle of her dragons' hatching and the Dothraki crossing the [[Narrow Sea]]. When Daenerys reiterates that she is destined to rule the Seven Kingdoms, Jon retorts that she will be ruling over a graveyard. [[Jon and Daenerys discuss his kingship.]] Tyrion says they cannot split their forces. Davos then speaks up for his king and tells Daenerys that Jon won the support of the wildlings and fought the White Walkers. Davos also mentions that Jon came back from the dead. Davos says that it doesn't matter who bends the knee. Tyrion doesn't see the point of Jon's refusal to submit. When Jon disputes Daenerys's claims to queenship, Daenerys responds that he is in open rebellion since he has declared himself King in the North. Daenerys then receives a message from [[Varys]]. Daenerys orders Missandei to give Jon and his men food and lodging. When Jon asks if he is a prisoner, she says not yet. [[Jon examines Dragonstone.]] Later, Jon and Tyrion discuss his predicament. Jon is unhappy his ship was taken away and is trapped on Dragonstone while the White Walkers and the Night King still pose a threat. Tyrion says he trusts the word of Jeor Mormont and Jon. Jon asks Tyrion how he can convince people about the existence of things which they don't believe exist. Jon wants to help his people and is frustrated with the deadlock. Tyrion encourages Jon not to give up. When Jon remarks that he is a fool for going south, Tyrion reassures him that the Mad King's daughter is not her father and has protected people from "monsters," telling him to speak with her servants. Tyrion asks if there is something he can do to help Jon.  [[Dany allows Jon to mine for the Dragonglass.]] While Daenerys is watching over her dragons, she is joined by Jon. Daenerys tells Jon that she named her dragons Rhaegal and Viserion after her brothers Rhaegar and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]], noting Jon's own losses and Jon nods. When Daenerys says people thought dragons were gone forever and perhaps they should be re-thinking what they believe they know, Jon realizes that Tyrion has been talking with her too. Daenerys tells Jon she is determined to remove Cersei. She allows Jon to mine the dragonglass and will provide what he needs for this. When Jon asks if she believes in the Night King and White Walkers, she only responds, "You better get to work, Jon Snow.""[[The Queen's Justice]]" Later, Jon leads Daenerys on a tour of the long-abandoned Valyrian dragonglass mine that Samwell Tarly told him about. The mine is ancient and impressive, used by the First Men long before the Valyrians came to Dragonstone. But this is not why Jon asked Daenerys to come.  As they proceed deeper into the mines led by torchlight, Jon shows her cave paintings they discovered left behind by the Children of the Forest, filled with arcane magical symbols. Daenerys is stunned that the mythical Children stood where they are standing now, thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before mankind ever arrived in Westeros. Jon says this isn't exactly true, leading her into another chamber, this one filled with narrative drawings of the Children and the First Men. Daenerys wonders if the Children and First Men fought each other, but Jon then shows her ancient carvings of the White Walkers themselves, one of which Jon recognizes as an image of the Night King. Jon explains that the Children of the Forest and the First Men only managed to drive off the White Walkers the first time during the Long Night because they chose to join together to fight off their own extinction, and that is the choice he and Daenerys have now.  Jon still wants Daenerys to ally with him to defeat the army of the dead, but Daenerys still wants him to bend the knee. He insists that the North won't accept a southern ruler again after everything they've gone through. Daenerys urges that they will if their king does, and asks Jon if their survival isn't more important than his pride. When Daenerys receives word about Casterly Rock and Highgarden, she becomes frustrated about her constant defeat and wants to attack the Red Keep with her dragons immediately. Tyrion advises against this, and Daenerys asks Jon for his thoughts. Jon tells Daenerys that he never thought that it was possible for dragons to live again, and that people follow Daenerys because she has done the impossible. He then warns her that if she uses her dragons to melt castles and burn cities, she will be just the same as those before her. Afterwards, Jon reunited with Theon who has survived his encounter with [[Euron Greyjoy]]. The anxious Theon asks Jon if Sansa is all right. Jon proceeds to scold Theon that what he did for Sansa was the only reason why he is still alive."[[The Spoils of War]]"  Some time later, Jon witnesses Daenerys returning to Dragonstone on Drogon. Drogon approaches Jon who does not flinch at the dragon and starts to pet him, much to Daenerys’s amazement. While they talk about leadership styles, they are approached by Jorah Mormont who has returned from Oldtown, who Daenerys tearfully reunites with. Jon then receives a letter regarding the army of the dead approaching Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Tyrion proposes a plan to capture a wight to prove Cersei about the existence of the White Walkers. Jon agrees and departs with Davos, Jorah, and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].  Jon arrives at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and heads out with a ranging party consisting of Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], [[Thoros]], [[Beric Dondarrion]], and a few others on a [[Wight Hunt|mission]] to capture a wight. They succeed but half of the party, including Thoros, end up being killed as they are attacked by wights, prompting Daenerys to intervene with all three of her dragons and leading to the death of Viserion by the Night King, who later resurrects the beast for his own use. Despite this devastating loss, Jon continues to fight and nearly drowns in the cold waters beneath the ice. Though he manages to pull himself out, he is all alone and nearly overwhelmed by the wights until a last-minute intervention by his long-lost uncle Benjen, who tells him to flee on his horse while he buys time for his nephew to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead. He makes it back to Eastwatch and is brought aboard the ship with Daenerys, Davos, and Sandor.  In the Narrow Sea, Jon wakes to find Daenerys sitting at his bedside. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks Daenerys, addressing her as "Dany", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother (and Jon's uncle) Viserys, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if "my Queen" would be more appropriate, agreeing to bend the knee. Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Daenerys is touched by his statement and they take each other's hand for a moment. They gaze into each other's eyes, before Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"  After recovering from his ordeal, Jon and the rest of his allies head to the [[Dragonpit]] to [[Dragonpit Summit|parley]] with the Lannisters. When Cersei dismisses their warnings about the Night King and his army as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses, they rattle the [[captured wight]] into lunging for her, making her and her allies see once and for all that the threat from beyond the Wall is real. Jon steps forward and picks up the wight's discarded hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros. Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the Army of the Dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict.  Daenerys and Tyrion rip into Jon over his ill-advised action. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill. Jon responds by arguing that while such an attitude may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. While Tyrion goes to talk to Cersei, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn, her family become less impressive as the power of the dragons waned, that they became like everyone else. Jon responds that Daenerys is not like everyone else. When Daenerys confides she was made infertile by [[Mirri Maz Duur]], Jon questions this, particularly when she admits it was Mirri Maz Duur who told her she was infertile. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens. Little do Jon and Daenerys know that Cersei has no intention of keeping her promise, and that she intends to let them fight the White Walkers on their own and mop up whoever wins with the help of the [[Golden Company]]. Jaime refuses to back down from his pledge to help fight the White Walkers and defies his sister-lover by traveling north. Whether he will warn Jon and Daenerys of Cersei's plan remains to be seen.  Later, as the two of them ride a ship to White Harbor, Jon enters Daenerys's cabin where the two of them begin to consummate their relationship, still unaware that they are aunt and nephew.  Meanwhile, back at Winterfell, Sam and Gilly arrive. The former visits Bran and the two of them discuss Jon's origin: he was born to Rhaegar and Lyanna at a Tower in Dorne, and is not a Snow at all, but a Sand. Sam realizes that that isn't true either, recalling the entry from High Septon Maynard's private journal about annulling Rhaegar's marriage. Bran expressed his doubts, but Sam reiterates the private nature of the journal and encourages Bran to use Greensight to confirm it. To his own surprise, Bran easily finds the wedding, where he sees a clearly happy Lyanna wedding Rhaegar in a Faith of the Seven ceremony before a Heart tree. Seeing forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words. Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar never raped Lyanna. She loved him and ran off with him, and bore him a son, Aegon Targaryen, making "Jon" not only legitimate but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
