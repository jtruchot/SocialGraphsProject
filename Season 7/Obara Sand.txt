= [[Obara battles Euron Greyjoy.]] After Daenerys and her fleet arrive at [[Dragonstone]],"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]" The Dragon Queen and her hand, [[Tyrion Lannister]], decide to send the Martell and Greyjoy fleets to Sunspear in order to stage a joint attack on King's Landing together along with [[House Tyrell]]. Obara accompanies Ellaria, [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]], and her sisters on the journey. Below the deck of their ship, Obara and Nymeria playfully tease Tyene. After they are ambushed by [[Euron Greyjoy]] and his fleet, both Obara and Nymeria confront Euron while Tyene protects Ellaria. As Obara spars the Lord Reaper of the Iron Islands with her spear, Nymeria attacks him with her whip; however, their attacks do little more than enrage Euron. [[Obara is slain with her own spear.]] Despite Obara wounding him in the side, Euron proves to be a more skillful fighter, who manages to disarm and ultimately stabs her in the stomach with her own spear, hoisting her into the air with violent motion. In her anger, Nymeria attacks Euron head-on, against her natural instinct to analyze her enemy's weak points, but is also killed by Euron. Obara's body is impaled at the front of the ship with her spear, next to the hanging Nymeria. Theon sees both of their corpses as he floats aimlessly on the water."[[Stormborn]]"
