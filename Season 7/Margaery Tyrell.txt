= During the meeting at [[Dragonstone]] to discuss marching full force on Kingâ€™s Landing, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] states that she does not want to be known as Queen of the Ashes (i.e. she doesn't want to rule over a country that must be destroyed to be conquered). Olenna remarks to Daenerys that Margaery was the most admired Queen within living memory, among both the nobility and the small folk, but now all that remains of her is ashes. She concludes that for Daenerys to claim the Iron Throne, she must be feared as well as loved, a trait Margaery lacked."[[Eastwatch]]"  After the death of her grandmother at the [[Sack of Highgarden]], the Lannister-[[House Tarly|Tarly]] forces are attacked by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], in which the surviving lords are asked to swear fealty to Daenerys. Despite the threat of death, Randyll Tarly announces that he already has a Queen in Cersei. However, Tyrion reminds him that Cersei killed Margaery, who was the rightful Queen Consort of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]."[[Eastwatch]]"  When [[Jaime Lannister]] returns home to [[King's Landing]] after the sacking of Highgarden and the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], he informs Cersei of Olenna's involvement in the murder of Joffrey, and explains her motivations to kill him in order to protect Margaery from the gruesome nature of Joffrey. In addition, Margaery would have been better able to control the more calm-natured and naive Tommen. He remarks that Olenna, her son and grandchildren are dead and that House Tyrell is officially extinct."[[Eastwatch]]"
