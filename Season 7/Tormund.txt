 7]] === [[180x180px|Tormund flirts with Brienne.]] As the castles at the wall are severely undermanned, Jon asks Tormund and the wildlings north to man them, to which Tormund agrees. Tormund is sent to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], as this is the castle closest to Hardhome where the Night King was last seen and, thus, a potential target. Before leaving, Tormund jokes that he and his Free Folk are the Night's Watch now. He later flirts with Brienne, and remarks [[Podrick Payne]] is a "lucky man" as Brienne knocks him to the ground."[[Eastwatch]]" [[Jon and Tormund prepare to journey beyond the Wall.]] A while later, Tormund is visited at Eastwatch by Jon, along with [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] and [[Jorah Mormont]], who have journeyed north to [[Wight Hunt|capture]] a wight to bring before Queens [[Cersei Lannister]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to convince them both of the common threat of the [[Night King]]. Tormund quips that they are not the only ones and takes them to the ice cells, where he is holding [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]], and [[Sandor Clegane]]. During the ensuing exchange, Tormund learns Jorah's real name and deduces he is the son of [[Jeor Mormont]], who hunted the wildlings "like animals", though Jorah retorts that the wildlings did the same to the Night's Watch. Hostilities are quickly put aside when they all accept they are on the same side and Jon frees the Brotherhood.   [[Tormund expedites beyond the Wall.]] Tormund joins Jon's expedition North to capture a wight. During the expedition, Tormund exchanges banter with Gendry and Jon Snow. When Jon explains that Daenerys will only ally with them if he submits to her rule, Tormund remarks that Jon has grown prideful and independent as a result of his time spent with the Free Folk. However, Tormund remarks that standing on pride can be a dangerous thing, using his late friend and leader [[Mance Rayder]] as an example. He later banters with Sandor Clegane, the latter shooting down the idea of Tormund winning Brienne's heart.  [[Gendry gives Tormund his warhammer.]] As they get closer to a pack of wights, they are attacked by an undead polar bear which mortally wounds Thoros but which is killed by Jorah. Later, they ambush a pack of wights led by a White Walker, and as soon as Jon slays the Walker, all but one of the wights fall lifeless. As the wight screams for help and Jon instructs Gendry to return to Eastwatch and send a raven to Daenerys, Tormund implores him to leave his warhammer behind as it will slow him down.  [[Tormund watches as Viserion is killed.]] The party ends up stranded in the middle of a frozen lake where Thoros eventually dies of his wounds. When the lake freezes over again, a fierce melee ensues. Tormund destroys many wights with a dragonglass battleaxe, but he is eventually tackled by two wights, who almost drag him underwater. He is saved at the last minute by Sandor. Daenerys eventually arrives and saves them with her dragons, though [[Viserion]] is killed by the Night King in the process, and they make it back to Eastwatch. Tormund helps them load the wight into a boat, and shares a farewell nod with Sandor in gratitude for saving his life."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"  [[180x180px|Tormund and Beric watch as the army of the dead attack the Wall.]] Some time later, Tormund and Beric are manning Eastwatch's defenses when the army of the dead arrives, led by the Night King astride a newly-reanimated Viserion. When Tormund sees the dragon bearing down on them, he screams for everyone to run. Tormund watches as Viserion [[Breaching of the Wall|burns right through the Wall]], causing Eastwatch to collapse. Tormund manages to escape the direct onslaught dragon-fire and watches as both wildlings and watchers are killed by the downfall of ice."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
