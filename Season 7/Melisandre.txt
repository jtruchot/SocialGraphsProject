 7]] === After being exiled from the North, Melisandre heard tales of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s impending arrival, and returns to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to meet her. Although Varys is hostile towards her due to [[And Now His Watch Is Ended|his hatred for blood magic]], Daenerys welcomes her in light of the assistance that [[Kinvara]] and the Red Priests of Volantis have given her. Cordial and, for the first time, without evangelizing, Melisandre tells the Dragon Queen about her search for [[The Prince That Was Promised]]. When Daenerys points out that she isn't a prince, the queen's translator [[Missandei]] explains this isn't actually a problem: the [[High Valyrian]] word for "prince" is actually gender-neutral and can mean "prince or princess." Melisandre avoids speculating on the promised one's exact identity, and tells Daenerys that she has a role to play in the war to come and so does the King in the North, Jon Snow. She urges Daenerys to meet with him and let him tell her the things he's seen. Tyrion is surprised by Melisandre's message but agrees, prophecy or no, that he could be a valuable ally and tells the Queen that he has more reason than she does to hate [[Cersei Lannister]]. Daenerys agrees to summon him so that he can bend the knee to her. Melisandre remains silent through the political discussion."[[Stormborn]]"  [[180x180px|Varys confronts Melisandre.]] When Jon finally arrives at Dragonstone, Melisandre stays back, observing from the cliffs. [[Varys]] meets her there and intuits that she's done something to anger the King in the North. Melisandre confirms that neither Jon nor [[Davos Seaworth|his adviser]] are fond of her due – in her own words – to mistakes that she had made. Melisandre says that she will stay away from both Jon and Daenerys as her days of "whispering in the ears of kings" are over. Melisandre declares that she has "brought ice and fire together" and that her work is done. Varys is delighted to hear that she will depart for [[Volantis]] soon, and advises her not to return to Westeros. Melisandre states that she cannot follow that advice, as she must return to Westeros once more to face her end: like Varys, it is her fate to die in Westeros."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
