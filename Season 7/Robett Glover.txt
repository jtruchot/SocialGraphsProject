 7]]=== [[Lyanna argues against Robett's sexism.]]Along with the rest of the lords of the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], Robett meets with the King in the North to plan for the [[Great War|coming war]] against the [[White Walkers]]. When Jon states that all Northerners will be conscripted, Robett initially objects to the idea of women, especially his granddaughter, being trained for warfare but comes around to the idea after Lyanna Mormont explains her support. He supports Jon's decision on pardoning [[Alys Karstark]] and [[Ned Umber]]."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  He is later present when Jon convenes another meeting at Winterfell. There, Robett reads [[Samwell Tarly]]'s letter regarding the vast amount of [[dragonglass]], a substance known to destroy White Walkers, on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] and is informed of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s letter regarding the fact that it would be wise if Jon would bend the knee to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and join the [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|war]] against [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Despite the wishes of Robett and other noble lords (who are concerned with the [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|tumultuous nature]] of Stark-Targaryen diplomacy), Jon still departs Winterfell, leaving Sansa as Lady Regent of the North."[[Stormborn]]"  [[Robett and Lord Royce speak with Littlefinger.]]While Jon is preoccupied with Daenerys and mining the dragonglass, Robett informs Sansa that Jon's absence has shown his arrogance as a King, implying that Sansa herself should take his place. Sansa rejects their proposal and stresses Jon's actions as essential. Privately, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] then suggests killing the troublesome lords, but is rebuffed by Sansa. Arya later observes Robett speaking with Lord [[Yohn Royce]] and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], prompting her to suspect that Littlefinger is plotting to overthrow Jon."[[Eastwatch]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
