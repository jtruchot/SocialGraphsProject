 7]]=== [[Lyanna secretly weds Rhaegar.]] While reading the journal of High Septon Maynard, who was known for recording every minor detail of his life, [[Gilly]] reads aloud to [[Samwell Tarly]] that Maynard issued an annulment for "Prince Ragger," who remarried at a secret ceremony in Dorne. This alludes to Lyanna, whom Rhaegar had married after Maynard annulled the marriage between Rhaegar and Elia, though Sam  and Gilly don't realize this at the time."[[Eastwatch]]"  Upon his arrival at Winterfell, Sam goes to see Bran, who shares his knowledge of Jon's true parentage with Sam. Bran believes that Jon Snow is actually Jon Sand as he was born in Dorne but Sam reveals Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, remembering Gilly's discovery. He tells Bran that Rhaegar and Lyanna were wed and asks if Bran can see this in a vision. Bran wargs into the past to see the wedding for himself. He confirms that it did happen and that Rhaegar was in love with Lyanna and she was in love with him. Bran then flashes forward to Lyanna's death, and hears Jon's birth name, whispered to Ned Stark with Lyanna's dying breath: Aegon Targaryen, the same as his [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|half-brother]]."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
