= Petyr watches disapprovingly as Jon hands the castles of [[Last Hearth]] and [[Karhold]] back over to [[Ned Umber]] and [[Alys Karstark]], despite their parents' role in the Battle of the Bastards.  [[180x180px|Petyr questions Sansa's happiness.]] He later confronts Sansa to see if she is truly "safe" and "happy." She tells him she is safe in [[Winterfell]], but he continues to question her in regards to her happiness. Sansa dismisses him. Just before he tries to resume speaking, Sansa dismisses Petyr again as Brienne arrives."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  [[Petyr admits his love for Sansa to Jon.]] In the Great Hall, Petyr watches as Jon discusses accepting the deal to meet with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to the other lords, citing the need for [[Dragonglass]] to forge weapons to kill [[White Walkers]] after receiving a raven from [[Samwell Tarly]]. Petyr smirks as Jon places his half-sister Sansa in charge of the North while he is gone. In Winterfell's crypts, Petyr finds Jon visiting his father's tomb and claims to Jon that he only wants to help him. Jon does not buy it and angrily orders Baelish out of the crypt, bluntly stating he has nothing to say to the man. Slightly offended, Baelish retorts that Jon might show him a little gratitude for saving him from death at the hands of [[Ramsay Bolton]]. He also admits his love for Sansa - just as he "loved her mother." Disgusted, Jon shoves Petyr against the wall and strangles him, angrily promising Baelish that he will kill him if he ever touches Sansa, and angrily leaves the crypts."[[Stormborn]]"  [[Petyr advises Sansa to plan for every possibility. ]] Sansa and Petyr learn from [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] that they have about 4,000 bushels of wheat. Sansa realizes that they don't have enough food for the coming winter. She advocates building granaries to stockpile for a famine and orders leather to be placed on the armoury. While walking, Baelish and Sansa talk about the threat of Cersei. Petyr urges her to fight every battle and to look for threats in every corner. They are then interupted by a guard who tells Lady Stark that she has received a visitor at the gates, who turns out to be her younger brother [[Bran Stark]]."[[The Queen's Justice]]"   Petyr later meets with the recently returned Bran and gives him the [[Valyrian steel dagger]] that was used to make an attempt on his life from the [[Catspaw assassin|catspaw]]. Unimpressed and uninterested, Bran simply asks if he knows who had the dagger before the assassin to which Petyr responds that same question started the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Petyr then asks Bran how he survived [[beyond the Wall]] only to return to such chaos. Bran replies, "Chaos is a ladder," the very thing Petyr said to [[Varys]] during his rise in power after allowing [[Joffrey Baratheon]] to kill [[Ros]]. Slightly unnerved, Petyr then exits upon the entrance of [[Meera Reed]], addressing Bran as "Lord Stark." However, Bran corrects Littlefinger, explaining that he cannot be a lord because he is now the three-eyed-raven.  [[180x180px|Littlefinger cunningly watches Arya's return.]]  Petyr watches from the battlements as [[Arya Stark]] returns to Winterfell and later when she spars with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]. However, after the practice, Arya looks up at Petyr with a disapproving and untrustworthy look. Yet again hatching another cunning plan, Petyr bows from the high walls and walks away from Arya's view."[[The Spoils of War]]"  After trying and failing to manipulate Bran, Petyr formulates a plan to separate the Stark sisters, starting with Arya. Arya herself becomes increasingly suspicious of Petyr and begins shadowing him in order to figure out his plan. He engages in conversation with a common girl, before giving her money for her information. Arya follows Petyr around Winterfell and watches him from the battlements as he eerily converses with [[Yohn Royce]] and [[Robett Glover]]. Petyr then receives Maester [[Luwin]]'s copy of Sansa's letter to Robb, asking him to surrender to Joffrey, from [[Wolkan]], who assures him that there is no other copy in Winterfell. Arya retrieves the letter after investigating his chambers. However, Petyr watches from the shadows as Arya exits, showing that he knew all along of her spying on him, and was counting on her to find the letter. Petyr smiles, hoping this will turn the hot-tempered Arya against her sister."[[Eastwatch]]"  After Arya confronts Sansa over the letter, Sansa becomes worried that Arya could turn the Northerners against her or even worse, harm her in some way and voices her concerns to Petyr. Petyr reminds her that Brienne swore an oath to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] that she would watch over both Stark sisters and should protect her from Arya if the latter was to try and murder Sansa."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"  Following this, Sansa receives a letter from Jon, stating his pledge to Daenerys Targaryen. Petyr then talks of rumors of the Dragon Queen's beauty, making Sansa believe that Jon wishes to marry her. Petyr is also told that Arya had previously worked as a [[Faceless Men|Faceless Man]] in [[Braavos]], to which he plays on the idea of Arya being a ruthless assassin. Petyr then tells Sansa that he always imagines the worst possible ideas a person has in their mind. He then implants the idea that Arya has come to Winterfell after discovering the letter and her marriages to Tyrion and Ramsay, after which she would become Lady of Winterfell."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  However, still unsure of Petyr's intentions, Sansa visits Bran. From this, she learns of his [[Greensight]] powers, in which he proves Petyr's ultimate guilt in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. This proves everything Petyr has done to gain power: his murder of [[Jon Arryn]], his attempt to kill Bran, his betrayal of Ned and his attempt to turn Arya and Sansa against each other.http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-7/episode-7/people/100/petyr-littlefinger-baelish [[Petyr watches smugly as Arya is brought to trial, unaware that the trial is for him.]] When Arya is seemingly brought to face trial for murder and treason, Sansa catches Petyr off guard when she asks how ''he'' wishes to answer for his crimes. She then reveals to all the Northern and Vale lords gathered there, including Yohn Royce (whom she previously lied to), that Petyr did, in fact, kill her aunt Lysa. He also planned the assassination of Jon Arryn and conspired with the Lannisters to imprison Ned so they could frame him for treason.  When Baelish tries to deny the charges, Bran reminds Petyr that he held a knife to Ned's throat and repeats what Petyr told Ned: "I did warn you not to trust me," at which the stunned Petyr fails to muster any type of defense. Arya, holding the [[Valyrian steel dagger]] that was given to the [[Catspaw assassin]] to kill Bran, who had himself been gifted the dagger by Petyr in an attempt of manipulating him, who passed it along to Arya due to its uselessness is his hands, reminds him that he told their mother the weapon belonged to Tyrion, but deduces it was Petyr's all along.  [[Baelish begs for his life.]] Seeing how things are going, Petyr steps closer to the table, telling Sansa that he has known her since she was a girl and all he did was to protect her; Sansa sarcastically replies "Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?." He then asks Sansa if they can speak alone and asks if he can or deserves to defend himself, before he tries to order Yohn Royce as Lord Protector to escort him back to the Eyrie, but the Lord scornfully refuses. With no one to turn to for aid, Petyr falls to his knees and begs for his life, claiming that he had loved Catelyn since he was a boy, but Sansa replies he still betrayed her. [[180x180px|Littlefinger lays dead in Winterfell.]] Petyr insists he loves Sansa, but she replies he betrayed her too. After Sansa thanks him for the many lessons he gave her and that she will never forget, sharing an affirmative look as Arya proceed to kill him. As he pleads for his life Arya slits his throat with the dagger on behalf of the Stark siblings. Petyr collapses to the floor and dies in a pool of his own blood watched by everyone present. Later on, Sansa and Arya discuss the execution, Sansa tells Arya, "In his own horrible way, I believe he [Petyr] loved me."  With Petyr Baelish dead, Westeros is finally free from his deception; all who were killed in the War of the Five Kings because of his actions are finally avenged.
