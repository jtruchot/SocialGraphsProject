 7]]=== [[Ellaria attends the Targaryen council meeting on Dragonstone.]] After Queen Daenerys sets up her base at [[Dragonstone]], Ellaria Sand attends a meeting with Daenerys, Tyrion Lannister, Princess [[Yara Greyjoy]], and Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] in the Chamber of the [[Painted Table]]. Ellaria and Yara advocate attacking King's Landing. However, Dany is unwilling to lay waste to the capital and create a bloodbath. When Tyrion confronts Ellaria about her role in the death of his niece Princess Myrcella Baratheon, Ellaria attempts to justify herself and states that her greatest regret was that Oberyn died fighting for Tyrion. Daenerys ends the argument by warning Ellaria to respect her [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Ellaria and Lady Olenna reluctantly acquiesce to Tyrion's plan to use the Martell and Tyrell forces to lay siege to King's Landing. Tyrion's plan involves using Yara's portion of the [[Iron Fleet]] to transport the Dornish and Tyrell forces across the [[Narrow Sea]] to King's Landing, allowing the xenophobic interpretation of foreign invaders to be depleted."[[Stormborn]]"  While traveling with Yara's Iron Fleet, Ellaria drinks Ironborn liquor with Yara and Theon, which she compares unfavorably to Dornish wine. Ellaria asks Yara if she had ever been to Dorne, to which Yara responds that she has been there a few times. Ellaria responds that there is a boy in every port in Dorne, which Yara responds, "A boy, a girl. Depends on the port."  [[Ellaria kisses Yara moments before they are attacked by Euron.]] Yara and Ellaria begin to sexually flirt with each other. Yara tells Ellaria that Theon will serve as both her bodyguard and adviser. Yara puts her feet up on the table. Ellaria bends over Yara and spreads her legs apart across the table. Ellaria moves her hand up Yara's leg towards her crotch. Ellaria invites Theon to have a threesome with her and Yara, but Yara tells Ellaria to "Leave him be." While Yara and Ellaria began kissing, Yara's ship is struck. On the deck above, they discover that their fleet has been ambushed by [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s portion of the Iron Fleet.  That night, their fleet is ambushed by Yara and Theon's uncle [[Euron Greyjoy]], who commands a larger faction of the Iron Fleet. Euron boards Yara's ship and his men overwhelm Yara's forces. Ellaria retreats below the deck with Tyene but Obara and Nymeria are killed by Euron. When Tyene, who was fighting off Euron's men to protect her mother, is overwhelmed, Ellaria pleads for a quick death, but Euron's men only smile and shake their heads as they take the women prisoner.They sail away, prisoners of war aboard the [[Silence|''Silence'']], en route to [[King's Landing]], leaving Yara's fleet to burn in the sea. [[180x180px|Ellaria and Tyene defiantly stare back at a glowering Cersei.]] In the aftermath of their capture, Euron takes Ellaria, along with Tyene and Yara, to King's Landing to present as his gift to Cersei. He parades them through the streets of the capital, and the crowd take great delight in pelting them with insults and trash. Euron throws Ellaria and Tyene in chains at the foot of the Iron Throne as a token of his loyalty. Ellaria spits hatefully at Cersei's feet, though she is clearly horrified at the sight of [[Gregor Clegane]] looming over them, even more monstrous than when he killed her lover."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  Later that same day, in the Red Keep's dungeons, Cersei has Ellaria and Tyene chained up on opposite sides of their cell, gagged. Cersei taunts Ellaria by sadistically recalling the Red Viper's savage death to Ellaria and how Ellaria screamed at the sight of it. She attempts to anger Ellaria by recalling how Oberyn looked beautiful that day, and his fearsome skill with a spear though it eventually didn't stop Gregor from killing him, as well as implying that Oberyn brought his death on himself by taunting Gregor at the last instead of finishing him when he had the chance. She then remembers raising Myrcella, and the fact that Ellaria murdered her. Cersei angrily demands to know why Ellaria murdered her only daughter, but the Dornish woman only grins mockingly at her in return.  However, Ellaria's mocking smile fades when Cersei turns her attention to Tyene, complimenting her daughter's "perfect Dornish beauty" and musing that she must be Ellaria's favorite child by her late paramour. Realizing that Cersei intends to kill Tyene in retaliation for Myrcella's death, Ellaria desperately tries to beg for her daughter's life, but with the gag muffling her, her pleas are unintelligible, as Cersei mockingly points out. Cersei notes how Ellaria chose to murder Myrcella and must have felt powerful after having done so. Cersei then expresses that she thought for a long time about how to destroy Ellaria; she thought of having Gregor crush Ellaria's skull like Oberyn's, but while poetic, it would be too swift a death. Cersei then continues that she thought about having Gregor crush Tyene's skull, but tauntingly remarks it wouldn't be right to have Tyene's "lovely face cracking open like a duck egg" as she removes the girl's gag and kisses her full on the lips. Ellaria's eyes go wide with horror as she realizes what Cersei is doing.  Tyene desperately calls out to her mother before [[Qyburn]] re-gags her, and Cersei reveals that Qyburn figured out what [[Long farewell|poison]] Ellaria used to kill Myrcella. As a heartbroken Ellaria falls to the floor, sobbing, Cersei has Qyburn confirm that the poison means certain death, but how long it takes to kill depends on the strength of the victim's constitution.  [[180x180px|The fate of Ellaria and Tyene.]] Cersei then triumphantly tells Ellaria that she will watch her daughter die in their cell, and then she will be forced to watch Tyene's "beautiful face crumble into bone and dust", and that they will keep Ellaria alive to watch that, even if they have to force-feed her to do it. Before leaving, Cersei orders the guards to frequently change the torches so Ellaria doesn't miss a moment of her daughter's death and decomposition. The moment Cersei is gone, Ellaria and Tyene frantically try to reach each other, but with their chains too short, they are unable to embrace or comfort each other before Tyene's inevitable death.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
