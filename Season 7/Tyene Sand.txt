= Tyene, her sisters, and their mother travel with [[Yara Greyjoy]]'s [[Ironborn]] fleet through the [[Narrow Sea]] to lay siege to [[King's Landing]]. Obara and Nymeria casually joke about killing Lannisters, and mock Tyene for her interjections of Ellaria's wisdom. Shortly later, Yara's fleet is [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|ambushed]] by the new [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]] [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s [[Iron Fleet]]. Tyene and Ellaria flee below the deck while a skirmish rages above; Tyene fights to defend her mother but she is ultimately overpowered by Euron's men. Obara and Nymeria are killed while Euron takes Tyene, Ellaria, and Yara prisoner."[[Stormborn]]" [[190px|Tyene and Ellaria captured and brought to Cersei.]] Euron proudly delivers Tyene and Ellaria to King's Landing, bringing them to the feet of Cersei as a gift. Ellaria spits at Cersei's feet, whilst Tyene stares defiantly at the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. The two of them cautiously eye the Mountain. Eventually, both Tyene and her mother are gagged and chained to the wall of a dungeon. After taunting Ellaria about Oberyn's death and lambasting her for murdering her daughter Myrcella, Cersei advances on Tyene, praising her "perfect Dornish beauty" and musing she must be Ellaria's favorite child by Oberyn.  Ellaria quickly realizes her captor's intentions and desperately tries to beg for her daughter's life, but being gagged, her pleas are unintelligible. Cersei muses that she contemplated having Gregor crush Ellaria and Tyene's skulls the same way he did Oberyn, but while poetic, in Ellaria's case, it would be too quick. Cersei then mockingly says it also wouldn't be right to have Tyene's "lovely face cracking open like a duck egg" as she removes the girl's gag and kisses Tyene full on the lips."[[The Queen's Justice]]" [[file:Ellaria-Tyene-the-end.jpg|thumb|Ellaria's attempt to hold Tyene as she dies prove futile.]] Tyene desperately calls out for her mother before [[Qyburn]] gags her again as Cersei explains that Qyburn figured out the [[Long farewell|poison]] Ellaria used to kill Myrcella, the same one she has used on Tyene. Qyburn assures Cersei that the poison will inevitably cause death, but how long depends on the strength of the victim's constitution. Cersei then gleefully informs a sobbing Ellaria that she will now be forced to spend her days watching Tyene die and decompose before her eyes, promising Ellaria they will keep her alive to do so even if they have to force feed her. Once Cersei is gone, both Tyene and Ellaria try to reach one another, but with their chains too short, they are unable to embrace or comfort each other in her last hours.
