= During a meeting at [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s council, Tyrion and Ellaria argue over her death. Tyrion states that Myrcella was an innocent girl, to which Ellaria responds she was killed due to her [[House Lannister|Lannister]] blood and that her greatest regret was that Oberyn died fighting for Tyrion's life. [[Euron Greyjoy]] later attacks Daenerys's fleet, personally kills Obara and Nymeria, and takes Ellaria and Tyene captive, intent on delivering them to Cersei to answer for Myrcella's murder."[[Stormborn]]" Tyene and Ellaria are brought before Cersei, who has them placed inside a dungeon where she proceeds to kiss Tyene with lips coated with the [[long farewell]], the exact same poison that the Sands used to kill her daughter, and leaves her to die with Ellaria watching, thus avenging Myrcella. "[[The Queen's Justice]]"  Despite Myrcella's death having been avenged, Cersei still holds Tyrion partially responsible, telling him that had he not killed their father Tywin, Ellaria would not have dared to touch her. Despite the circumstances Tyrion offers his condolences, claiming that he loved both Myrcella and Tommen and is deeply sorry for their deaths, a truth which Cersei knows she can't deny."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"
