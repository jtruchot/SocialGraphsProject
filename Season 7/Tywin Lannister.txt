Randyll counters that Cersei is at least a true [[Westeros]]i, and that Tyrion is a kinslayer, having killed his father, as well as supporting a foreigner; bringing savages to their continent."[[Eastwatch]]"  When Tyrion confronts Cersei in the Tower of the Hand (coincidentally, in the very office that both he and Tywin occupied during their tenures as Hand of the King) she once again blames him for their father's death, claiming that her children Myrcella and Tommen would not have lost their lives if Tywin had remained alive. Tyrion does not deny his killing of Tywin, adding that to some degree he hates himself for killing his own father, in spite of the cruelty Tywin showed him all his life."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
