= After [[Cersei Lannister]]'s coronation, Tycho is sent to Westeros in order to get back the money the Crown owes the Iron Bank. He meets with Cersei and the two discuss Cersei's position in the world and in the war against [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. During the conversation, Tycho admits that the Iron Bank had made strong profits in the [[Slavery|slave]] trade which has now been [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay|destroyed]] by Daenerys. Cersei actually manages to convince Tycho to stay in King's Landing for a fortnight, promising that he will return to Braavos with her debt paid in full - by the ancestral wealth of [[House Tyrell]]."[[The Queen's Justice]]" Tycho later meets with Cersei, who compliments her for paying back much of her massive debts in a single payment, noting that he does not believe the Iron Bank has ever been paid back in such a manner. He flatters Cersei by telling her that she seems to be almost surpassing her father in this regard; Cersei thanks him for his kindness, addressing him as a lord, but Tycho points out he is neither kind nor a lord, but merely an employee of the Iron Bank, boring Cersei, who is eager to plan her defence against Daenerys. [[180x180px|Tycho listens to Cersei's plans.]] Tycho tells Cersei that some of his colleagues may be disappointed as they were interested in bringing up Cersei's interest rates. Nonetheless, he suggest that the Iron Bank may be able to invest in Cersei's venture to reestablish her control over the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Cersei informs Tycho that her [[Hand of the King|Hand]], [[Qyburn]], has reached out to the [[Golden Company]], a powerful [[Mercenary|sellsword company]] in [[Essos]]. Tycho assures Cersei that they will support the [[Iron Throne]] - once they get their gold."[[The Spoils of War]]"
