= [[180x180px|Thoros asks The Hound to look into the flames.]] Thoros, along with the other members of the Brotherhood travel north, but end up staying at a hut which Sandor stopped in a few years ago with Arya. There, Thoros shows Sandor the power of R'hllor, asking him to look into the fire. The Hound witnesses a vision about the [[Wall]], [[wight]]s and [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. Thoros later helps Sandor bury the previous residents of the hut, a [[Farmer]] and his daughter, [[Sally]]."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]" [[Thoros journeys beyond the Wall.]] Thoros gets taken prisoner along with Beric and Sandor Clegane by the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] guarding the [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] on behalf of the [[Night's Watch]]. After finding them in the cells where Thoros is recognized by [[Jorah Mormont]], Jon Snow frees them to join the excursion team going [[Beyond the Wall|north]] to [[Wight Hunt|capture]] a [[wight]]."[[Eastwatch]]" On the journey, Thoros questions whether [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] is still upset with the Brotherhood selling him. Gendry reveals that [[Melisandre]] tried to kill him, which Thoros deduces was part of a [[Leech ritual|ritual]] that needed Gendry's blood. When Gendry persists in his anger toward them, the Hound tells him that he's just needlessly complaining, and Thoros offers Gendry a drink, which he grudgingly accepts.  Shortly after the group finally reaches the mountain peak the Hound had seen in the fire, one of the group's scouts sees a large figure in the distance, much larger than a human. When the creature charges after noticing, it is quickly revealed to be a wight [[snow bear]], which makes short work of the scout. Beric and Thoros both light their blades aflame, and the entire group engages. In the course of fighting the beast, another in the group is killed, and Thoros is gravely injured by the bear when he tries to protect Sandor, receiving severe lacerations on his abdomen and chest. Beric uses the fire on his sword to cauterize the wounds, while Thoros comments on how strange his life has become considering he was bitten by a dead bear. Thoros is helped to his feet and continues on, though weakened from his injuries. [[Thoros reflects on the Greyjoy Rebellion.]] Thoros and Jorah briefly discuss Thoros's role years ago during the [[Siege of Pyke]], with Jorah fondly remembering the ironborn fearing Thoros's flaming sword. However, Thoros reveals that he doesn't remember the siege he became famous for, having been far too drunk at the time and only hearing about his great feat afterward. Despite his words, Jorah tells Thoros that at the time he thought Thoros was the bravest man he had ever met. Thoros, with a smile, humbly tells him that he was simply the drunkest, before the two continue on their trek beyond the wall. They continue to make their way north until they run into an advance patrol of wights, led by a [[White Walker 1 (Beyond the Wall)|White Walker]].   [[180x180px|Thoros is found frozen to death.]]Jon engages the leader, killing it with [[Longclaw]]. All but [[Captured wight|one]] of the wights shatter. They manage to bind the sole remaining wight and carry it when they are forced to flee to a stone island in the middle of a frozen lake. One of the expedition is overtaken by the running wights and pulled under the ice. The cracking ice expands as more dead advance and fall in. Soon the entire island is encircled by a line of broken ice, so the dead are halted. The expedition is forced to remain overnight, and it is during this time that Thoros freezes to death, devastating Beric. At Jon's instruction, Beric burns the corpse with his flaming sword to prevent the Red Priest from returning as a wight."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"
