 7]]=== [[The Night King leads his armies south.]] The Night King is shown leading his army of wights and White Walkers south, departing the Lands of Always Winter and heading towards the Wall at last.  [[Sansa Stark]] and Jon Snow later discuss who the more dangerous enemy is, [[Cersei Lannister]] or the Night King, as well as the fact that the Wall still separates humanity from the White Walkers."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  Meanwhile, despite her obsession with defeating [[Cersei Lannister]], who sits the [[Iron Throne]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]], a royal exile who has begun her [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|war for Westeros]], is told by Jon Snow, who has traveled to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], that she will only be ruling a graveyard if the Night King attacks, as he is the true enemy."[[The Queen's Justice]]" [[Jon unveils a carving of the Night King.]] Jon takes Daenerys down into the caves on Dragonstone after she agrees to allow he and his [[Northmen|people]] to mine the dragonglass beneath Dragonstone. However, Jon has something much more important in mind: showing her the ancient carvings by the Children of the Forest on the rocks, which depict the Children of the Forest and the First Men fighting the White Walkers together. One of these carvings strongly resembles the Night King leading the White Walkers."[[The Spoils of War]]" [[The Night King leads his army towards Eastwatch.]] When [[Bran Stark]] [[warg]]s into a flock of [[raven]]s, he flies them [[beyond the Wall|beyond]] the [[Wall]] to spy on the [[Wight|army of the dead]]. He finds the Night King himself leading them, flanked by some of his lieutenants. When the Night King looks up, the ravens disperse, and Bran is pulled out of the warging. He urges [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] to send ravens across [[Westeros]] informing the high lords that the Night King is on the move to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]."[[Eastwatch]]" [[The Night King observes the events of the Wight Hunt.]]  The Night King is present when the wights battle Jon Snow at the [[Wight Hunt]], who traveled beyond the Wall with a band of warriors to attempt to capture a [[Captured wight|wight]] to use as proof for the gathered [[Lordship|high lords]] of [[Westeros]]. Remembering their encounter from Hardhome, the Night King keeps his gaze on Jon for some time. [[Beric Dondarrion]] suggests trying to kill the Night King; as they know, killing a White Walker kills any and all wights it raised, so killing the Night King might destroy every such monster under his command, putting an end to the Great War before it truly begins. Jon dismisses the plan, however, arguing that trying to fight their way through the wights to reach the Night King would be suicide. [[The Night King kills Viserion.]] When [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her [[dragon]]s come and attempt to rescue Jon and his group, the Night King hurls an [[White Walker ice blade|ice spear]] toward [[Viserion]], piercing the young dragon straight through the neck. Trailing blood and fire, Viserion crashes down to the frozen lake, sinking beneath the icy waters. The King keeps his gaze on the enraged Jon, who appears on the verge of calling him down to fight directly, but [[White Walker 2 (Beyond the Wall)|his lieutenant]] hands him another spear. The Night King throws it at [[Drogon]], but the dragon takes flight and dodges in time. The Night King later has his wights haul Viserion's corpse out of the water.  [[The Night King breaches the Wall using the undead Viserion.]] Once that is accomplished, the Night King kneels in front of the dragon's snout, placing a hand upon him. Moments later, Viserion is reanimated as his eyes open, now a depthless, icy blue."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]" The mounted White Walkers lead the gathered army of the dead out of the [[Haunted Forest]] to the Wall, gathering in force at [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. Riding the reanimated Viserion and using his fiery breath, the Night King [[Breaching of the Wall|breaches]] the Wall, burning it until the easternmost portion of the icy fortification collapses, destroying the castle and allowing the White Walkers and their wight army to invade Westeros once more while the Night King flies overhead toward the [[North]]."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
