 7]]=== [[left|180x180px|Alys and Ned swear fealty to Jon.]] Ned is at the council of [[North|Northern]] and [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] lords in [[Winterfell]]'s main hall held by the new [[King in the North]] Jon Snow. [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] suggests giving the Last Hearth to an ally of Jon, but Jon dismisses this idea, as Ned wasn't to blame for Smalljon Umber's actions. Jon speaks his name and Ned stands up from amongst the other lords, a full head shorter than them and wearing an expression of fear and uncertainty. Jon then motions for him and [[Alys Karstark]] to walk forward and stand before him; fearing that he will have them executed, Ned and Alys obey. However, Jon does not show any desire to punish them for their fathers' actions and instead asks them to once more swear fealty to House Stark. Visibly relieved, Alys and Ned draw their swords, kneel before Jon and declare they will serve House Stark "now and always", retaining his position as [[Lord of the Last Hearth]]."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  Ned is also present when Jon announces his plans to leave for [[Dragonstone]], to make an alliance with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in order to defeat the Night King, and leave Sansa in control of the North."[[Stormborn]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
