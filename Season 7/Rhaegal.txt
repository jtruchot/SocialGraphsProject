 7]]=== Rhaegal and his brothers fly ahead of their mother as she lands on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. They investigate the island as Daenerys enters and secures the castle."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  Upon [[Jon Snow]]'s arrival at Dragonstone, Rhaegal and his brothers fly overhead and visibly scare both him and [[Davos Seaworth]]. Tyrion then comments that he has not yet gotten used to them either.

During the battle, the [[Night King]] fatally wounds [[Viserion]] with an ice spear to the neck. Rhaegal swoops after him in a desperate attempt to help, but it's too late; he can only cry in despair as Viserion crashes through the frozen lake and slowly sinks into the waters."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"  Daenerys brings Rhaegal to the [[Dragonpit Summit]], as a show of power: he circles overhead as she lands on Drogon's back. Bringing Rhaegal proves to be a minor error, however, as [[Cersei Lannister]] notices Viserion's absence and correctly concludes that something has happened to him, brushing off [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime's]] suggestion that the third dragon is guarding the fleet."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
