 7]]=== Varys notes to Daenerys that her father was cruel and mad, and that Robert Baratheon was a vast improvement. Later, [[Olenna Tyrell]] explains how her father wasn't peaceful in the least, but Daenerys should be still be ruthless if she is to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.  After receiving a letter from Daenerys, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] debates whether to meet her at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], but Sansa reminds him of her father's role in the death of their grandfather.  Cersei then hosts the [[Lordship|lords]] of the [[Reach]] at court, giving various hints that Daenerys will bring on the same tyranny as her father, as well as having a touch of the Targaryen madness."[[Stormborn]]"  Jon Snow brings up the fact that he shouldn't claim fealty to Daenerys, based on what her father did to his uncle and grandfather. Daenerys, though, makes a point to apologize on behalf of her house for the crimes of her father."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  After the execution of [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]] following the [[battle of the Goldroad]], Varys compares Daenerys to Aerys, as he did the same with Rickard and Brandon Stark. Varys then implores [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to make her listen, fearing that this will make her be viewed in a similar fashion to her father."[[Eastwatch]]"  When Jaime tries to leave Cersei and ride north to fight the [[Wight|army of the dead]], after its existence has been proven true by [[Jon Snow]], she prevents him from leaving by threatening to kill him as a traitor. In this moment Jaime can see Cersei as the power-mad tyrant she really is. It's possible that Jaime can see a great resemblance to the Mad King in her, as she's willing to let the whole realm perish if that means she can keep her crown."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
