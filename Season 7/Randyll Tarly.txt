 7]]=== [[Randyll confronts Cersei about Daenerys' dragons.]] Randyll travels to [[King's Landing]] at the request on [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], the new [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|queen of the Seven Kingdoms]]. Cersei implores Randyll and the other lords of the [[Reach]] to pledge fealty to [[House Lannister]] in order to defend [[Westeros]] from [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her combined army of [[Dothraki]] and [[Unsullied]]. [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] speaks to Randyll alone and claims that Randyll is the most prominent of the lords of the Reach, and that the others will look to him when choosing sides. Randyll is reluctant to ally with the House that orchestrated the [[Red Wedding]] and [[Oathbreaking|break his oath]] to House Tyrell.  [[Randyll marches on Highgarden with the Lannister army.]] Jaime reminds Randyll of his oath to the crown, appeals to his xenophobia reminding him that [[Olenna Tyrell]] is bringing savages and eunuchs to Westeros and promises him the title of [[Warden]] of the South."[[Stormborn]]" Despite his initial objections, Randyll eventually sides with the Lannisters and, together with Jaime and [[Bronn]], leads the main part of the 10,000 men strong Lannister army against [[Highgarden]] where they easily [[Sack of Highgarden|take and loot]] the castle, killing Olenna in the process."[[The Queen's Justice]]" Following the sack, Randyll and Dickon report to Jaime that Highgarden's granaries are being emptied, and that teams of Tarly men are collecting the year's harvest from all of the farms in the Reach.  [[Randyll battles the Dothraki at the Battle of the Goldroad.]] Later, as the Lannister army is encamped along the [[Blackwater Rush]], Randyll reports that the gold plundered from Highgarden has safely arrived at King's Landing. He also asks Jaime's permission to flog their army's stragglers, in an effort to increase mobility. Jaime requests that he warns the men first, to Randyll's dismay. Shortly thereafter, the Lannister-Tarly army is [[Battle of the Goldroad|attacked]] by Daenerys and her Dothraki. Randyll and Jaime attempt to rally their troops, but they are no match for Daenerys's [[Drogon|dragon]] and superior numbers. The Lannisters are quickly overrun and slaughtered."[[The Spoils of War]]" [[Daenerys herds Randyll and the Lannister forces.]] The prisoners of war are later herded by the Dothraki to Daenerys and Drogon behind her, waiting menacingly. Daenerys appeals to them, bringing up the rumors spread about her by Cersei, and warnings of brutality that the dragon Queen would bring - burning down homes, and murdering families. She assures she is not here to murder, but to destroy the wheel of power that rolls over the rich and poor alike, to no one's benefit but people like Cersei. She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die.  Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this, most of the soldiers kneel immediately, intimidated by Drogon. However, Randyll, Dickon, and a handful of other men remain steadfast. Daenerys summons Randyll forward and asks him to reaffirm his choice: he insists he already has a Queen. Tyrion recalls he didn't pledge to Cersei until recently, and that she [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|murdered]] the rightful [[Margaery Tyrell|queen]], destroying House Tyrell for good. He observes Randyll's allegiances are questionable to which Randyll answers there are no easy choices in war. He tells Tyrion that Cersei is a true Westerosi, and that Tyrion is a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]], having killed his father, as well as supporting a foreigner; bringing savages to their continent. Daenerys accepts his answer and prepares to carry out a sentence, but Tyrion intervenes with the possibility of sending Randyll to the Wall, instead of death. However, Randyll points out that Daenerys cannot send him to the Wall as she is not his Queen.  [[Randyll and Dickon refuse to bend the knee.]] Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tells his son to shut up and insists to Daenerys that he's a foolish boy. On identifying himself, Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly and reminding him of the loss of House Tyrell, for the good of his House urges him to bend the knee, which Randyll silently nods in agreement to Dickon. Dickon refuses to relent his decision, thereby Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to cells instead so they can stew and give them time to change their minds.  [[180x180px|Randyll is incinerated by Drogon alongside his son.]] Daenerys, however, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes to carry out the sentence for them both, as Randyll reaches over and takes Dickon's hand in his own. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, roasting Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them almost instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution."[[Eastwatch]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
