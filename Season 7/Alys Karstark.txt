 7]]=== Alys is present at a council of [[North|Northern]] and [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] lords in [[Winterfell]]'s main hall presided over by the [[King in the North]], Jon Snow. The council discussing how to deal with the coming threat of the [[White Walkers]], and how to deal with the fallout of the defeat of the Boltons. Sansa suggests giving [[Karhold]] to one of the Northern lords who had been a proven ally of the Starks, but Jon dismisses this idea, as Alys wasn't to blame for her father's actions. The argument of what to do with the surviving Karstark and [[House Umber|Umber]] children goes back and forth. [[left|At Winterfell, Alys Karstark and [[Ned Umber]] renew their Houses' vows of fealty to the Starks.]] Ultimately, Jon calls Alys and [[Ned Umber]] forward. They are visibly afraid that Jon will announce that he will execute them. Instead, Jon holds to his original position that he will not hold them responsible for the crimes of their fathers, and orders them to swear fealty to the Starks once again. Relieved, without hesitation Alys and Ned ceremonially kneel, draw their swords, and swear to serve Jon and the Starks. This allows Alys to retain her inheritance as the new [[Lord of Karhold|Lady of Karhold]].  Alys is also present when Jon announces his plans to leave for [[Dragonstone]], to make an alliance with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in order to defeat the [[Night King]], and leave Sansa in control of the North."[[Stormborn]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
