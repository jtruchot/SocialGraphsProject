 7]] === [[180x180px|Missandei arrives on Dragonstone.]] Missandei arrives on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], accompanied by Daenerys, Varys, Tyrion and Grey Worm. She follows Daenerys from the shore of the island to the hall of the castle. Knowing this is her defining moment, and coming home, Missandei stops Grey Worm from continuing into the Chamber of the [[Painted Table]] with Daenerys."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  [[Missandei and Grey Worm console each other.]] After witnessing Tyrion's announcement that the Unsullied will attack [[Casterly Rock]] to seize it, that being Daenerys's first move in the [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|upcoming war]], on Daenerys's council, Missandei visits Grey Worm in his chambers, presuming that he will lead the attack. There they engage in a conversation in which Grey Worm tells her that all the Unsullied have to face their weaknesses, his only weakness being her, leading to a tender kiss. When she realizes what he wants, Missandei removes her clothes, but when she tries to remove his, too, he hesitates before letting her see his castration wounds. Then they start making love by him orally pleasuring her."[[Stormborn]]"  [[180x180px|Missandei escorts Jon Snow to her queen.]] Missandei, Tyrion, and several Dothraki including Qhono, greet the [[King in the North]] [[Jon Snow]] and his adviser [[Davos Seaworth]] on the shores of Dragonstone. After Tyrion and Jon exchange pleasantries, Missandei orders the Northmen to lay down their weapons, which they oblige. While walking up to the castle, Missandei talks with Davos, who takes an interest in her homeland of [[Naath]]. On the way, the group is startled by Queen Daenerys's dragons but Missandei and Tyrion maintain their composure.  In the throne room, Missandei introduces her Queen by her many titles. During the meeting, Dany demands that Jon Snow bend the knee and pledge fealty to her. Jon Snow is reluctant to bend the knee due to the historical animosity between the [[House Stark|Starks]] and Targaryens dating back to the time of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Jon Snow also warns Daenerys about the threat posed by the [[White Walkers]] and their [[Wight|undead armies]]. The two sides are unable to reach a common ground due to Jon Snow's reluctance to submit to Daenerys and Dany's skepticism of the existence of White Walkers and Wights. After receiving news from Varys that Yara's fleet has been attack, Dany adjourns the meeting and tasks Missandei with giving Jon Snow and his followers lodging and food for their stay."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  [[Missandei attends a council meeting at the Painted Table.]] After learning that Euron's [[Iron Fleet]] has wiped out much of Yara's fleet, Missandei, Tyrion, and Varys attend a meeting with Queen Daenerys. When Daenerys proposed riding with her dragons to raze the Iron Fleet, Missandei and Tyrion argue against it because they do not have information on Euron's location and the fear that one stray arrow may kill Daenerys. Missandei is present when Tyrion briefs the council about the Unsullied's assault on the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] seat of [[King's Landing]]. Grey Worm leads a successful assault on the castle only to learn that the bulk of the Lannister forces have retreated and that they have stumbled into a trap as Euron's Iron Fleet burn the ships that brought them, stranding the Unsullied men.  [[180x180px|Missandei informs Daenerys about her and Grey Worm's relationship.]] Daenerys and Missandei head down to the beach. Missandei is worried about [[Grey Worm]] because they haven't heard any news from [[Casterly Rock]] yet. Daenerys asks what happened between her and Grey Worm, and Missandei wryly says "many things", smiling. She then continues into the caves with Jon, Daenerys and Davos. Upon exit, they are informed of the events of the [[Sack of Highgarden]] and the [[Fall of Casterly Rock]]. Following the information, her queen decides on riding [[Drogon]] into battle, staging the events of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]]."[[The Spoils of War]]"  Davos and Jon encounter Missandei as they wait for her queen to return. She politely inquires why Jon's surname is "Snow" even though [[House Stark]] has ruled the North for centuries, and his father Ned and brother Robb both had the surname "Stark" but he doesn't. Jon and Davos explain to her the special system of regional surnames used in Westeros for [[Bastardy|bastard]] children of the nobility. Missandei doesn't know what they mean, so they literally explain that Jon's parents weren't married. Davos asks if they have similar customs for bastards on [[Naath]]. Quizzically, Missandei explains that "[[Marriage]]" as such does not exist in Naath, so she finds the idea of a "bastard" to be quite an alien concept. Davos says that sounds liberating. Jon then asks when she left, to which Missandei finally reveals that she was taken by slavers, to be freed only years later by Daenerys. When Davos suggests Missandei simply traded one master for another, she counters that she and all the freed slaves serve Daenerys because they ''choose'' to. Davos keeps pushing, asking what would happen if Missandei decided to return to Naath immediately. She responds that Daenerys would give her a ship and wish her good fortune."[[The Spoils of War]]"  While Missandei, Davos and Jon are still on the causeway, they see a lone ironborn ship approaching the island, a survivor of Yara Greyjoy's fleet. [[Theon Greyjoy]] himself and some of his men come to shore on a rowboat. As they disembark, Theon and the ironborn encounter Jon while Missandei, Davos and a few Dothraki escort guards witness a confrontation between Jon and Theon since when they both last saw each other before Jon was leaving [[Winterfell]] to join the Night's Watch.  After the death of [[Viserion]] at the hands of the [[Night's King]], Daenerys agrees to pledge all her forces to the Northern cause, changing the objectives of Missandei's queen."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"  Missandei sails into King's Landing, with Varys, Theon, Jon and Tyrion, nervously watching: the [[Iron Fleet]] dominates [[Blackwater Bay]] with their vast ships. Upon arrival, they are escorted to the [[Dragonpit]] by [[Bronn]]. Missandei then watches as the [[Dragonpit Summit|parley]] unfolds, in which Cersei is shown a [[wight]]. When Jon declares he has pledged allegiance to Daenerys, Cersei refuses to commit to the [[Great War]]. She ultimately pretends to agree after a conversation with Tyrion. Unbeknownst to all, Cersei reveals to Jaime that she has no plans to help fight the dead in the Great War, and is secretly hoping the Army of the Dead will defeat them for her. Missandei later sails to [[White Harbor]], as Daenerys and Jon join all their collective forces to defeat the Night King."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
