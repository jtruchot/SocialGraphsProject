= [[Hot Pie reunites with Arya.]] Hot Pie meets up with Arya again when she arrives at the inn, where he informs her of recent events in [[Westeros]], notably the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]. He goes on to remark that Arya must be going to Winterfell. When Arya asks why she would go to Winterfell when it is held by the [[House Bolton|Boltons]], he tells her House Bolton was defeated by [[Jon Snow]] and his "wildling army" in the [[Battle of the Bastards]], and that Jon is now [[King in the North]].  This changes Arya's travel plans, as she originally intended to go to King's Landing to kill [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] but now she chooses to go home to her family instead of seeking revenge. She then tries to pay Hot Pie, but he rejects it, saying that friends don't need to pay for the ale and the pie. He then remarks on his stupidity for not realizing she was a girl - and a pretty one. Before she leaves, Arya tells her friend to not get killed, and Hot Pie assures her that, like her, he's a survivor."[[Stormborn]]"
