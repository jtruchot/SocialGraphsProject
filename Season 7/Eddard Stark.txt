Petyr then reveals he loves Sansa in the same way, prompting Jon to angrily slam Petyr against the wall and tell him not to touch his sister. Afterward, Jon leaves the crypt and Petyr follows a few moments after to avoid association with a fight between them."[[Stormborn]]"  When Jon Snow visits [[Daenerys Targaryen]] at [[Dragonstone]], she makes it clear that Ned was clearly on Robert's side during his rebellion and was, therefore, a traitor."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  Upon [[Arya Stark|Arya]]'s return to Winterfell, she manages to sneak away from disbelieving guards and into the crypts. She looks upon the statue of her father, and is then reunited with Sansa, where they both discuss how the statue doesn't resemble Eddard. Sansa says that there is no one left who would remember his face and therefore make an accurate statue, to which Arya says that they are still alive and remember him."[[The Spoils of War]]"  Jon and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] bond over their fathers, Ned and [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], having been friends.

While searching through his mattress, she finds a scroll written by Sansa.

Arya is unaware that Sansa had written the letter under duress from Queen Cersei in an attempt to save their father.  [[Jorah Mormont]] and Jon discuss their fathers, [[Jeor Mormont]] and Ned Stark.

Then there are no more answers, only better and better lies. And lies won't help us in this fight."  During Jon and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]'s conversation, they talk about Ned. Jon tells Theon, "Our father was more of a father to you than yours ever was. And you betrayed him." Theon agrees. Jon continues, "But you never lost him. He’s a part of you, just like he’s a part of me."  At Petyr's surprise trial in Winterfell, [[Bran Stark|Bran]] reveals Baelish's betrayal of Eddard in shocking detail.
