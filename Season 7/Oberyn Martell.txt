 7]] === Ellaria notes that her greatest regret was that Oberyn died for Tyrion at his trial. Later, [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] tells her sisters [[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] that her mother Ellaria told her that Oberyn died because of his carelessness. They are then both killed soon after by [[Euron Greyjoy]]."[[Stormborn]]"  In the black cells of the Red Keep, Cersei enrages Ellaria by reminding her that Oberyn's carelessness caused his death, and that his killer, Ser Gregor, is stronger than ever. Even though the [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|murder]] of [[Myrcella Baratheon]] by Ellaria was meant to avenge Oberyn, it only proved to be one of her worst decisions, as Tyene is poisoned by Cersei with the [[long farewell]] as Ellaria did to Myrcella. Ellaria is left to helplessly watch her daughter slowly die and eventually decompose before her eyes."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
