[[180x180px|Cersei threatens Petyr.]] He responds by referencing her incest, reminding her that with knowledge, comes power. Littlefinger receives a violent reprimand when Cersei tells her men to cut Littlefinger's throat but then says she has changed her mind, in order to remind him of his place, and that being born into power can never match Petyr's ambitiousness, threatening his life if does not locate Arya. King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] responds to the ensuing rumors by ordering a city wide [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre]] of [[Robert Baratheon|his father's]] bastards.

In order to convince her that it is best for her to keep up her work, Littlefinger intimidates [[Ros]] with a story of a [[Lys]]ene who did not bring him significant income due to her sadness, who he eventually sold to a violently perverted individual. He allows her to take the rest of the day off, but asks her to resume her work the following day.
