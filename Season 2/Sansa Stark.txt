 2]]=== [[Sansa remains a captive.]] Sansa remains a captive of Queen Regent Cersei in King's Landing. She has learned to feign loyalty to Joffrey to avoid further abuse from him.

Joffrey causes a citywide [[Riot of King's Landing|riot]] by demanding that his guards kill all of the smallfolk present. In the chaos, Sansa is separated from the rest of the group and as she tries to flee to safety, she is pursued by a group of men who nearly rape her. She is rescued by the Hound, just as Tyrion is in the process of browbeating Joffrey for losing her in the first place. Shae treats her injuries and Sansa confides she thought the rioters were going to kill her, observing how they hated her and wonders why they would hate a stranger so much. Shae replies it is because Sansa has more than they will ever have, that her horse eats better than their children. Sansa says she would have given them food if she had it and she too hates Joffrey more than anyone. Shae warns her not to say such things and to trust no-one."[[The Old Gods and the New]]"  [[Cersei and Sansa chat following Sansa's first "flowering."]] Sansa has a nightmare that she is being stabbed by her attackers from the riots.

The Hound catches them and (reluctantly) informs the Queen. Cersei gives Sansa advice on motherhood, reassuring her that even if she never loves Joffrey, she will love her children with him. However, Cersei tells Sansa not to love anybody except for her children, "The more people you love, the weaker you are.""[[A Man Without Honor]]"  [[271x271px|Sansa during the Battle of the Blackwater.]]  [[Stannis Baratheon]] sails his fleet into the bay outside King's Landing, triggering the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

She then takes refuge in Maegor's Holdfast with Shae where Cersei is hosting the women of the court there. Cersei mocks Sansa's faith and reveals Ilyn Payne is present to kill them all if the walls are breached. She drunkenly advises Sansa to use her sexuality as a weapon. Eventually, Cersei storms out, believing the battle lost. Sansa attempts to keep the morale of the women up with prayers and singing.  Later, Shae tells Sansa to return to her chambers and bar her door to keep her safe should Stannis breach the keep. Sansa finds Sandor waiting for her inside.

[[Petyr warns Sansa of her lack of protection.]] Sansa's revelry is halted by Petyr consoling her; she pretends to be upset.
