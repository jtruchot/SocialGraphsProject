 2]]=== [[Craster]] tells [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] that Mance is assembling an army in the [[Frostfangs]]. [[Varys]] reports rumors of the wildlings organizing under Mance to the [[small council]]."[[The Night Lands]]" [[Qhorin]] predicts that the wildlings will be more dangerous under Mance because he used to be a man of the [[Night's Watch]] and knows their tactics."[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"  When she is captured, [[Ygritte]] points out to [[Jon Snow]] that the wildlings chose Mance Rayder to lead them, and he's not "King-Beyond-the-Wall" because his father was. Ygritte also says that Mance Rayder chose to desert from the Night's Watch to join the Free Folk."[[A Man Without Honor]]" Ygritte reverses the situation and takes Jon prisoner. She argues to the [[Lord of Bones]] that Mance will want to question Jon because he is the bastard son of [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]], so they shouldn't just kill Jon on the spot. The Lord of Bones has also captured Qhorin and they march back to Mance with both captives.  When Jon Snow slays Qhorin, Ygritte mentions to the Lord of Bones that he can tell Mance Rayder who killed Qhorin. Jon's ropes are cut and they stand before Mance's encampment.
