The Queen orders the knight to bring her before them. Ser Mandon and one of his sworn brothers then bring in [[Ros]], whom Cersei mistook for Tyrion's lover (which was actually [[Shae]])."[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"  Immediately prior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Ser Mandon informs Cersei of a groom and two maids attempting to flee with a stolen horse and some gold cups. She orders Ser Mandon to have [[Ilyn Payne]] put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning."[[Blackwater]]"  During the battle, Ser Mandon and Ser [[Boros Blount]] remain at the side of King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] as he oversees the [[King's Landing|city]]'s defenses alongside [[Tyrion Lannister]], the [[Hand of the King]]. When the forces of [[Stannis Baratheon]] reach the city and begin invading it, Joffrey departs for the safety of the [[Red Keep]], at the urge of Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], and orders Ser Mandon and Ser Boros to aid Tyrion.  [[Podrick kills Mandon when he tries to kill Tyrion.]] Tyrion urges a host of men-at-arms to help him fight the invaders and orders Ser Mandon and Ser Boros to join him in leading the battle. Ser Mandon is also ordered to carry the royal banner. In the midst of battle, Ser Mandon attempts to murder Tyrion, right after Tyrion thought he was safe and took his own helmet off. Ser Mandon narrowly misses making a killing stroke, by mere inches â€“ the stroke only succeeded in badly slashing Tyrion across the face. Mandon readies to kill Tyrion with a second sword stroke but is then killed by Tyrion's [[squire]], [[Podrick Payne]], who drives a lance through the back of his head.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
