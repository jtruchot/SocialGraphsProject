 2]]=== [[At one year old, Grey Wind stands as tall as a man's waist.]] When Robb approaches his hostage [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] at camp, Grey Wind slowly emerges. Grey Wind has grown larger and stands protectively next to Robb, who caresses his back. After Robb leaves, Grey Wind inches closer to Jaime and taunts him with a snap, before leaving to rejoin his master."[[The North Remembers]]"  Grey Wind plays a decisive role in the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. The direwolf sneaks into the Lannisters' camp and frightens their horses, as well as killing several sentries. Without their horses the Lannister army is easily slaughtered as they are roused from sleep by Stark cavalry. Such an impression is made on Lannister forces that terrified rumors spread in [[King's Landing]] that Robb attacked the Lannister camp using an entire army of wolves."[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
