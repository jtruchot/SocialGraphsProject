= [[Winterfell gathers to witness Bran surrendering to Theon]] After Winterfell is [[Fall of Winterfell|seized by ironborn raiders]] led by [[Theon Greyjoy]], Farlen is among the members of the [[House Stark|Stark]] household forcibly assembled at the castle's yard to witness Prince [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s official yielding to Theon. Farlen refuses to serve Theon, and insists he's a servant of House Stark. One of the ironborn raiders, [[Drennan]], beats him over the head with a club. He is helped up off the ground by his daughter. They are both present when Theon assembles the people after the escape of Bran and [[Rickon Stark]] and unveils two charred corpses and hangs them up on either side of the castle gates."[[A Man Without Honor]]"  Farlen and his daughter were likely put to sword by Ramsay Bolton's men during the [[Sack of Winterfell]], as they are never to be seen again after Winterfell is [[Battle of the Bastards|retaken]] and House Stark is restored as the ruling house of the North.
