 2]]=== [[Pyat Pree, representative of the Warlocks before the Thirteen]] After centuries of decline, the magical power of the warlocks grew stronger in the weeks following the hatching of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s [[dragon]]s. Some time after her arrival in Qarth, the Warlocks, through [[Pyat Pree]], form an alliance with [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] to kidnap both the dragons and Daenerys herself in exchange for their aid in making Xaro the [[King of Qarth]].  Since their magic was strongest in the presence of the dragons, and they were strongest in hers, they planned to keep both her and the dragons prisoner in the House of the Undying. Daenerys, however foils their plans when her dragons kill Pyat Pree and Xaro Xhoan Daxos. She escapes the House of the Undying afterwards and, shortly after, leaves Qarth by ship.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
