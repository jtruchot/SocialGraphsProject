 2]]=== Cressen is worried about the influence that the red priestess [[Melisandre]] has over Stannis, and is horrified when she gets him to renounce the [[Faith of the Seven]]. When she has the carved wooden statues of the Seven burned on the beach, he speaks out against doing this. He says that all of them were [[Nameday|named]] in the light of the Seven, and they risk the wrath of the Gods. Cressen tries to talk to [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] about going against her, but Davos refuses, saying that right now is not an opportune time to act. The maester decides that if Stannis can't be talked into putting Melisandre aside she must be killed, before she leads him into a war he cannot win. [[180x180px|Cressen dies in an attempt to kill Melisandre.]] Later Cressen sits at the Painted Table, at a council meeting with Stannis, Davos, and Melisandre. When he puts [[poison]] in a cup of wine, Davos silently urges him to stop, but he does not. Walking around the table, Cressen says that they should put their differences aside and asks Melisandre to drink a toast with him. He drinks from the cup first and hands it to her. She watches him and sees his nose start to bleed. She knows it's poison, but with a smile she drinks the rest of the wine anyway. As he dies almost immediately, she stands over him, unaffected by the poison. As she watches him die her red ruby necklace begins to glow."[[The North Remembers]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
