= During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Stone Hedge is occupied by [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces. Following the liberation of [[Riverrun]] at the [[Battle of the Camps]], Robb Stark tasks one of his commanders, Lord [[Greatjon Umber]], with the expulsion of Lannister forces from the lands of the Riverlords. Umber first liberates [[Raventree Hall]], the ancestral seat of [[House Blackwood]], and then moves to restore Stone Hedge which is then reclaimed by its rightful lord, Jonos Bracken.
