 2]]=== After learning the true parentage of Joffrey and his siblings, Stannis has his scribe [[Matthos Seaworth]] prepare a letter to be distributed to the Seven Kingdoms. As Matthos is reading a rough draft of this letter to Stannis, the latter orders the reference to Robert as his "beloved brother" be taken out since he and Robert never loved each other. When Joffrey hears the "rumors" about his parentage as well as the fact that Robert had other children, he realizes that his enemies may think that Robert's bastards have a better claim to the throne than he does. In response to this threat, he orders the [[City Watch of King's Landing]] to hunt down and kill all of the bastards. Under the leadership of [[Lord Commander]] [[Janos Slynt]], the Watch carry out a city-wide [[massacre in King's Landing|massacre]] of Robert's bastards, including the infant [[Barra]]. The only bastard known to have escaped this slaughter was [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
