= [[Khal Drogo holding Rhaego in a vision.]] [[Daenerys's family that never was.]] After [[Pyat Pree]] tells Daenerys that her stolen [[dragon]]s are in the possession of the [[warlocks]] of [[Qarth]], in the [[House of the Undying]], she goes there to recover them. There, she sees different visions, including one of a Dothraki ''khal'''s tent in a snow storm, [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the [[Wall]]. Upon entering, Daenerys finds herself back in her former home while on the [[Dothraki Sea]] in Drogo's tent. Before her are her dead husband and child, both alive again. Rhaego is seen as a small adorable boy in the arms of Drogo. Daenerys shares an emotional moment with them. Drogo says that he doesn't know if this is a dream, but if it is he will kill the man who tries to wake him. Though she longs to stay, Daenerys hears her dragons in the distance and realizes that both Rhaego and Drogo are only an illusion. She turns and walks away, and as she goes, the emotion drains from Drogo's eyes."[[Valar Morghulis]]"
