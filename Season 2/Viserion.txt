 2]]=== [[Viserion (far right) and his brothers burn [[Pyat Pree]].]] Viserion is not shown as much, until he is stolen by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], along with Drogon and Rhaegal. When Daenerys enters the [[House of the Undying]] to retrieve them, she eventually finds her three dragons chained. [[Pyat Pree]] attempts to chain her with [[magic]], claiming that her dragons make his magic strong and that she makes them stronger; thus she will stay with them for an eternity. Daenerys whispers to her dragons, "dracarys," her command to breathe fire; the three of them proceed to burn Pyat Pree alive, releasing them from his magic.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
