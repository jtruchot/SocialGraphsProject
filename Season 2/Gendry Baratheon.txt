 2]]=== [[Gendry and Arya take cover from the gold cloaks.]] Gendry travels north on the [[Kingsroad]] with [[Yoren]] and his recruits, befriending Arya on the journey. He is targeted by the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] of [[King's Landing]] because of his status as a bastard of King [[Robert Baratheon]], but remains unaware of his lineage."[[The North Remembers]]" Yoren intimidates a pair of [[Gold Cloak (The Night Lands)|gold cloaks]] who come looking for Gendry into leaving empty handed. Gendry sees through Arya's disguise and recognizes her as a girl. She confides her identity and swears him to secrecy. Gendry is embarrassed for talking so crudely to a highborn member of a noble house, though the tomboyish Arya is herself embarrassed at his deference to her as a "Lady.""[[The Night Lands]]"  The gold cloaks return with Ser [[Amory Lorch]] and a force of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers. They [[Raid by the Gods Eye|attack]] the group, kill Yoren and capture Arya and Gendry. Arya manages to convince them that [[Lommy|Lommy Greenhands]], whom [[Polliver]] had killed, was Gendry because he was carrying the bull's head helm that Gendry made."[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]" The prisoners are then taken to [[Harrenhal]]. They are brutally tortured by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]'s men while being questioned by the [[Tickler]]. Gendry is selected as his next victim, but is saved when Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] arrives and chastises his men that the prisoners are more useful alive. To prove his point, Tywin asks Gendry if he has a trade, and when Gendry says that he is in fact a trained blacksmith, Tywin shoots a stern look at Gregor's men."[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"  [[Arya criticizes Gendry's swordsmanship.]] Gendry is put to work at the castle's forge."[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]" Whilst Gendry practices his swordsmanship, which is criticized by Arya, the Tickler is found dead in suspicious circumstances, his neck snapped. Some days later, Ser Amory is murdered via a [[wolfsbane]] dart."[[The Old Gods and the New]]" The deaths prompt Tywin to launch an investigation and he ultimately blames infiltrators from the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], a resistance group whom the Tickler was trying to gain information on."[[A Man Without Honor]]"  [[Arya, Gendry and Hot Pie escape Harrenhal.]] Tywin leaves Harrenhal to lead his army on the march (though rather than heading west to fight [[Robb Stark]], he in fact races back south to fight Stannis in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]). Before they leave, Arya arranges for [[Jaqen H'ghar]] to help them to escape the castle."[[The Prince of Winterfell]]" It turns out Arya was right to make their escape attempt then, as when the Lannister army withdrew soon afterwards, they massacred every remaining prisoner at Harrenhal."[[Valar Dohaeris]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
