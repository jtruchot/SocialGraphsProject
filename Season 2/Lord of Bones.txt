 2]]=== [[The Lord of Bones wears the front of a [[Giants|giant]]'s skull as a mask and bones as armor.]]  [[Ygritte]] takes [[Jon Snow]] to the rest of the warparty and introduces him, to the Lord of Bones, as "a present". The wildling commander is dismissive of Ygritte's arguments to keep him alive, as he already has [[Qhorin]] as prisoner. He relents, however, after Ygritte's insistence and the reminder that [[Mance Rayder]] would want to decide for himself whether the [[Bastardy|bastard]] son of [[Eddard Stark]] lives or dies. However, he threatens Ygritte to castrate Jon should he try to escape. As the warband and their prisoners march to Mance Rayder's camp in [[Skirling Pass]], Qhorin attacks Jon, blaming him for the deaths of [[Stonesnake]], [[Borba]] and [[Harker]]. The Lord of Bones warns Qhorin not to strike his captive again."[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"  When Halfhand attacks Jon once again, as part of his plan to have Jon infiltrate Mance Rayder's host, the Lord of Bones orders his men to let the two fight. After Jon kills Qhorin, the Lord of Bones cuts the ropes binding his hands together and orders his men to burn the Halfhand's corpse. He turns to Jon and taunts him that he would not want Qhorin's corpse [[Wight|coming back]] for him."[[Valar Morghulis]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
