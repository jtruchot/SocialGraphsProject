[[Sandor Clegane|Sandor Clegane]] watches on in disgust at Trant's behavior."[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"  [[Tyrion Lannister]] interrupts the assault on Sansa and asks Meryn what kind of knight beats a helpless girl; he answers with "the kind that serves their king." [[Bronn]] sarcastically warns Meryn to be careful of getting blood on his white cloak. Tyrion orders Sansa covered and reminds Joffrey that she is his betrothed. He rebukes Joffrey for absurdly punishing Sansa for events she had no part in. He also notes what became of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], who also did what he liked until he was killed by Joffrey's uncle [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. Meryn warns Tyrion not to threaten the King; Tyrion counters that he is educating his nephew. He instructs Bronn to kill Meryn if he speaks again and points out that that is a real threat. Tyrion helps Sansa up and walks her out of the throne room.  [[Ser Meryn Trant refuses to heed Tyrion's orders.]]  Ser Meryn, along with the rest of the [[Kingsguard]], is present when Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]] is sent to [[Dorne]] alongside her sworn shield and Meryn's sworn brother, Ser [[Arys Oakheart]]. When Joffrey provokes a [[Riot of King's Landing|riot]], Ser Meryn cuts down several enraged [[smallfolk]] before bringing the King to safety.
