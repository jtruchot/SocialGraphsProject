 2]]=== Polliver is a Lannister [[man-at-arms]] under the command of Ser [[Amory Lorch]]. He accompanies Lorch in the [[Raid by the Gods Eye|attack]] on [[Yoren]] and his [[Night's Watch]] recruits. He knocks [[Arya Stark]] over when she runs to join the fight and takes [[Needle]] from her, saying amusingly that he will pick his teeth with it. When the Lannister forces are victorious, Amory says that they will take the survivors back to [[Harrenhal]].  As they are rounding up the survivors, Polliver approaches the injured [[Lommy]], who has been shot with a bolt in his leg and says Polliver needs to carry him. Polliver seemingly obliges and offers a hand, but instead stabs the boy in the neck with Needle. Coughing up blood, Lommy chokes to death as Polliver returns to his fellow men-at-arms and mocks Lommy's request. Arya fools Lorch and his men into believing that Lommy was their target; the Royal [[Bastardy|bastard]] [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]. Gendry is actually among the captives."[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]" [[file:Polliver.jpg|thumb|Polliver takes [[Needle]].]] Lorch and his men deliver the prisoners to Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] at [[Harrenhal]]. Gregor oversees the torture of the captives, killing several of them. After Arya sees Polliver beating up an [[old woman prisoner]] for asking him for a crust of bread, she adds his name to her hit list. Gendry is selected to be tortured while Polliver stands guard. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. Polliver interjects that the prisoners will not be there long. Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. Polliver catches Arya looking at Needle in his sword belt and orders her to kneel, calling her "boy." Tywin immediately realizes that she is a girl and calls Polliver an idiot. He asks why she has dressed as a boy and she says that it was safer to travel. He says that she is smart and orders the prisoners be put to work. He says that Arya will be his new [[cupbearer]]."[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
