You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon. Not his steward, not his captain of the guard, and not his wife. Only Stannis himself.|Tomard|Yes, my lord.|Eddard Stark and Tomard|You Win or You Die '''Tomard''' is a [[Man-at-arms|guardsman]] sworn to [[House Stark]].  ==Biography== ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== He accompanies [[Eddard Stark]] south to [[King's Landing]] when he becomes [[Hand of the King]], and is usually seen guarding him with [[Jory Cassel]]. He is with Eddard when [[Renly Baratheon]] brings news of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s hunting injury. Eddard instructs Tomard to hand deliver a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Tomard is not present when Eddard and the majority of his guard are killed."[[You Win or You Die]]" He escapes from the capital and successfully delivers the letter, thus he is one of very few (if any) of the Stark Household to have survived the [[Massacre in the Red Keep]]. His destination after he completes his assignment is unknown.  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|7=yes|||||||8 = |9 = |10 =   ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tomard is nicknamed Fat Tom. He is easily fooled and prone to stating the obvious. He becomes the Captain of [[Eddard Stark]]'s personal guard, following the death of [[Jory Cassel]] and the departure of Jory's replacement Alyn with Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]].   As in the show, Tomard is entrusted to deliver a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]], but is explicitly told to do so during a sea journey North with Eddard's daughters. Unlike in the show, [[Massacre in the Red Keep|he is killed along with the majority of the guards]] when Eddard is betrayed by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] in the Throne Room. The letter is taken from his body, and later presented to [[Sansa Stark]] as an "evidence" to her father's alleged treason.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   House Stark   [[Category:Living individuals]] [[Category:Men-at-arms]] [[Category:Northmen]] [[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]] [[Category:Smallfolk]]   [[fr:Tomard]] [[ru:Томард]] [[zh:托马德]]
