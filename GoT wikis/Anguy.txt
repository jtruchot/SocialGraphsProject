He coerces an unwilling Hot Pie into following them to a nearby [[Inn at the Crossroads|inn]] by making an impressive trick-shot. Later on, he presents a captured [[Sandor Clegane]] to his companions and is met with a roar of approval, and is present when Sandor reveals Arya's identity."[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]" [[File:Arya the climb.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Anguy teaches Arya archery.]] After bringing his captive before [[Beric Dondarrion]], he voices his disgust over the atrocities committed by the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces at the [[Mummer's Ford]]."[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]". Later he is present during the trial by combat which the Hound kills Lord Beric and is freed from his accusations."[[Kissed by Fire]]"  Anguy teaches Arya how to shoot a bow properly, when confronted by [[Melisandre]], who has come to claim [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] for the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]]. He does nothing to stop her, earning himself the wrath of Arya."[[The Climb]]"  When Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, Anguy is sent to bring her back. He is unsuccessful when she is captured by the Hound instead and taken away."[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 3 appearances||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes  ==Gallery==  Arya the climb.jpg|Anguy teaches Arya how to properly use a bow in "[[The Climb]]".   ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Anguy is a superb archer from the [[Dornish Marches]], the mountainous southern region of the [[stormlands]] which borders [[Dorne]]. He won the archery competition during the [[Tournament|Hand's tourney]] and was approached by Alyn, a guardsman on orders from [[Eddard Stark]] to offer him a place on the Stark household guard, but Anguy drunkenly declined. Anguy is part of the [[Iron Throne]] host assembled by [[Eddard Stark]] to execute Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and becomes one of the founders of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|brotherhood without banners]] after the [[battle at the Mummer's Ford]].  Many characters who later formed the brotherhood were introduced at the Hand's tourney in the first novel. This tourney did occur in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] of the TV series, but the characters were not introduced, because they would not make a significant appearance until Season 3 - they are briefly mentioned in the first novel but only reappear as "the brotherhood" in the third novel (though as in Season 2 of the TV series, in the second novel characters do mention that something called "the brotherhood" is harassing Lannister supply lines).  After the [[Red Wedding]], the brotherhood finds [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]'s body. Despite Thoros's objection, Beric passes her his flame of life; he dies, and Catelyn is reanimated as the monstrous Lady Stoneheart. Under the leadership of Lady Stoneheart, the brotherhood falls low, and currently it is no longer different than any outlaw band; as a result, Anguy and many others abandon the brotherhood.   ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   [[Category:Brotherhood Without Banners]] [[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]] [[Category:Outlaws]] [[Category:Smallfolk]] [[Category:Stormlanders]]   [[de:Anguy]] [[ru:Энгай]]
