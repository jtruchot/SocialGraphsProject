He is acting [[First Ranger]] when [[Benjen Stark]] is away from the [[Wall]].  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== Ser Jaremy attends the induction of new recruits into the [[Night's Watch]]. He is the acting first ranger in the absence of [[Benjen Stark]] and summons the recruits assigned to the rangers after the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]]'s speech. He leads an escort for [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] when they go [[Beyond the Wall|north of the Wall]] to take their vows in the [[Godswood]]. He embraces his newly sworn brothers after they take their vows. They discover the bodies of rangers [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]] near the Godswood and return them to [[Castle Black]]. The dead men had accompanied Benjen on his scouting mission beyond the Wall."[[You Win or You Die]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]] === Following the [[Breaching of the Wall]], Jaremy's fate remains unknown."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|7=yes  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Jaremy is an officer in the rangers of the [[Night's Watch]]. Ser Jaremy attends the officers meeting with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and recalls being sent to the [[Wall]] by [[Tywin Lannister]] after fighting for [[House Targaryen]] in the [[Sack of King's Landing]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It is Ser Jaremy rather than Ser Alliser who challenges Sam about his decision to take his vows in the Godswood. He is not named as being part of the escort to the Godswood. He identifies the bodies when they are returned to Castle Black.  Ser Jaremy and four other men were killed by the wight [[Jafer Flowers]]. Jaremy managed to hack the wight's head off, but was killed when the headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels.  Give that Ser Jaremy is not shown to be killed in the episode, it is possible that he simply wasn't killed in the TV continuity.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Watch navbox   DEFAULTSORT:Rykker, Jaremy [[Category:Crownlanders]] [[Category:House Rykker|Jaremy Rykker]] [[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]] [[Category:Knights]] [[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]]   [[de:Jaremy Rykker]] [[fr:Jaremy Rykker]] [[ru:Джереми Риккер]]
