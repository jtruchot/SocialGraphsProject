And piss on the North! We're going as far south as south goes!|Stiv to Osha|A Golden Crown '''Stiv''' was a [[Night's Watch]] [[Desertion|deserter]] who was killed while fleeing south of the [[Wall]].  ==Biography== ===Background=== Stiv is a deserter of the Night's Watch who has fled south with [[Wallen]], a fellow deserter, and [[Osha]], a [[Free Folk|wildling]].  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== Stiv, Osha, and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the [[White Walkers]]. In the woods near [[Winterfell]] they stumble across [[Bran Stark]] and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], for a reward, but decide against it. [[Robb Stark]] intervenes, and kills Wallen and disables Osha. Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat, and despite Bran's protests not to, Robb lowers his sword as Stiv tells him to. However, [[Theon Greyjoy]] shoots him through the back with an arrow, killing him. Osha surrenders to [[House Stark|Stark]] custody."[[A Golden Crown]]"  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|6=yes  ==Gallery==  Stiv and Osha.jpg|Stiv with [[Osha]] in the Wolfswood in "[[A Golden Crown]]".
