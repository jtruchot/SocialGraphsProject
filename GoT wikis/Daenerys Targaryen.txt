Daenerys was initially a timid, obedient youth. After her marriage to [[Drogo]] she gathered the confidence of his ''[[khalasar]]''. Following his death, she expanded her dominion into Essos, gaining the loyalty of an army of [[Unsullied]] and [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay|liberating Slaver's Bay]] from the [[Ghiscari]] slave masters.  During her [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|war for Westeros]], Daenerys eventually succumbed to the so-called "[[Targaryen madness]]" of her ancestors after a series of personal losses, grief, and betrayal. [[Battle of King's Landing|Razing King's Landing]] despite its surrender, Daenerys seized power after killing Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], along with countless [[Smallfolk|common folk]]. Unable to be dissuaded from further destruction, she was [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinated]] by her nephew [[Jon Snow]] to prevent further carnage. She was later succeeded by [[Bran Stark|Bran the Broken]], [[Elections|elected]] by the [[Great Council of 305 AC]].  She formally styled herself as '''Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|Queen of the Andals and the First Men]], [[Protector of the Seven Kingdoms]], the Mother of Dragons, the ''Khaleesi'' of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains''', though the style was occasionally shortened to '''Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons'''.   ==Biography== ===Background=== [[File:HL The Last Dragons.png|thumb|Daenerys and Viserys live as urchins.]] Daenerys was conceived during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. To escape [[Robert Baratheon]]'s wrath after the [[Sack of King's Landing]], in which Daenerys's father, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|niece]], and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|nephew]] were killed, the pregnant Queen Rhaella and young Prince Viserys were sent to the island-castle of [[Dragonstone]], where the queen gave birth to Daenerys. On that night, a severe summer storm raged, giving Daenerys the epithet "Stormborn." Her mother died shortly thereafter, leaving Daenerys and her brother orphans.[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/map/special/journey-of-daenerys/1/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, special features - Journey of Daenerys, Flight from Dragonstone entry]  As a baby, she was taken into exile in the [[Free Cities]] with her brother by loyal retainers, among them Ser [[Willem Darry]].[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/viserys-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Viserys Targaryen entry][http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rhaella-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rhaella Targaryen entry] After years spent fruitlessly trying to raise support to retake the [[Iron Throne]], Viserys and Daenerys were given sanctuary by [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]] in the Free City of [[Pentos]]. During this time, Daenerys lived in constant fear of Viserys, who hit her when his temper was risen (in his words, whenever she "woke the dragon"). Living under Viserys's domination left her meek and malleable.[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/map/special/journey-of-daenerys/2/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, special features - Journey of Daenerys, Seeking Refuge in Pentos entry]  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== [[File:Daenerys_and_Viserys.jpg|thumb|Viserys insists on Daenerys's marriage to Drogo.]] Over a year after Illyrio welcomed the Targaryens into his home, Daenerys is betrothed to [[Marriage|marry]] ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] of the [[Dothraki]]. As Viserys presents her with a wedding gown gifted by the magister, he strips her naked and fondles her under the pretext of examining how she has grown. After he leaves, Daenerys enters a bath that her [[Pentoshi servant|servant]] warns her is too hot, but it does not affect her.  A short time later, Drogo arrives at Illyrio's manse. After taking a brief look at Daenerys, Drogo rides away without dismounting his horse. Viserys is concerned, but Illyrio assures him that if he did not approve of Daenerys, they would have known. After their departure, Illyrio and Viserys discuss the quest to sail back to Westeros, and Viserys inquires when the wedding will take place. Daenerys is not pleased with the arrangement and blurts out that she does not want to marry Drogo. Viserys insists that Daenerys will marry him, because, in return, Drogo will give Viserys the army he needs to retake their father's throne from Robert Baratheon. Viserys adds that he would let his sister be raped by all forty thousand of Drogo's men and their [[horse]]s if it meant getting his throne back.  At the wedding, she accepts a variety of gifts. From Illyrio, she receives three [[dragon]] eggs from the [[Shadow Lands]] beyond [[Asshai]]. The magister tells her that they have been turned to stone by the passage of time. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], a [[Knighthood|knight]] of Westeros, brings books about the Seven Kingdoms and offers Viserys his service. She is given a [[Silver|white mare]] by Drogo. Daenerys says the mare is beautiful and wants to thank Drogo, asking Jorah what the [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]] word for 'thank you' is. Jorah tells her that there is no such word in their language. On their wedding night, Drogo forcefully takes the tearful Daenerys's virginity."[[Winter Is Coming]]"  [[File:Flatlands.jpg|thumb|Daenerys moves west with Drogo's ''khalasar''.]] While traveling to [[Vaes Dothrak]], Jorah notices that Daenerys is struggling to cope with Drogo's sexual appetites, giving her dried horse meat to eat in order to keep her strength, telling her of the Dothraki [[ghost grass]] theory and telling her that her marriage will get easier. Later, as Drogo has violent loveless sex with Daenerys, her attention becomes fixated on her gift from Illyrio. Becoming increasingly curious with the dragon eggs, Daenerys asks her handmaidens if they have ever heard of dragons surviving in the east.  [[File:Daenerys & Doreah 1x02.png|thumb|Doreah teaches Daenerys.]] They reply no, but [[Doreah]], a former [[Prostitution|prostitute]] from [[Lys]], tells her an old story about how there used to be two moons in the sky. One wandered too close to the sun and cracked like an egg, spilling out thousands of dragons into the world. Daenerys's Dothraki handmaidens [[Irri]] and [[Jhiqui]] dismiss the story, saying that the moon is a goddess, wife to the sun. Daenerys seeks advice from Doreah, trained in the [[pleasure house]]s of Lys, on how to best please her husband. Doreah teaches Daenerys how to use her sexuality to influence Drogo and win the status of an equal in his eyes."[[The Kingsroad]]" Irri teaches Daenerys to speak the Dothraki language.Cite  [[File:Daenerys_1x03.png|thumb|Daenerys leads her ''khalasar'' across the Dothraki sea.]] While traveling further eastward, Daenerys commands the ''[[khalasar]]'' to halt, and wanders into a glade. Viserys, enraged at the idea of being commanded by his sister, then attempts to renew his control over her, but [[Rakharo]] defends her from his attempts at violence, stating (through Irri's translation) that he should take an ear from him to teach respect. At first, she begs her men to spare him, but at an encouraging stare from Ser Jorah, she grows confident and orders them to spare Viserys, although he is shamed by being forced to walk. Daenerys discovers that she is pregnant with Drogo's child. She assuredly predicts that she will have a son, to Drogo's approval. The pregnancy buoys the love between them."[[Lord Snow]]"  Arriving at [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys asks Jorah if he thinks the Dothraki could retake the Seven Kingdoms for her house. Mormont points out the difficulties of persuading them to cross the [[Narrow Sea]], but believes success would be possible if that could be accomplished and if King Robert was foolish enough to meet them in open battle. He says that if their opponents retreated behind stone walls, the Dothraki would not be able to root them out. They move to discuss Jorah's background, and he admits to selling poachers on his [[Bear Island|land]] as [[Slavery|slaves]] to raise money for his [[Lynesse Hightower (daughter of Leyton)|expensive wife]]. When Daenerys asks him where his wife is, Jorah replies that she is with [[Tregar Ormollen|another man]] in [[Lys|another place]].Cite  Daenerys invites Viserys to dinner, and provides fresh clothing in the Dothraki fashion for him. Viserys reacts angrily at being dressed in the "rags of savages" and strikes Daenerys. However, for the first time in her life, Daenerys fights back, hitting Viserys across the face with a heavy gold belt. As her astounded brother gawps at her, Daenerys furiously reminds him of her position as Drogo's wife and the mother of his child, finishing with a threatening promise that if Viserys raises a hand to her again, she will have both of his hands cut off."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"  Unbeknownst to Daenerys, Jorah sends word of her pregnancy to the [[Master of Whisperers|spymaster]] [[Varys]] in [[King's Landing]], where King Robert orders her assassination."[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"  [[File:Dany and the egg.jpg|thumb|Daenerys studies one of her dragon eggs.]] Daenerys studies her dragon eggs. Despite Illyrio's claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. As she removes the egg from the brazier, Irri enters her tent and hurriedly takes the egg so as to not let Daenerys burn her hands, but while Irri does suffer burns, Daenerys is completely unharmed.Cite  [[File:Dany-heart.png|thumb|Daenerys eats the heart of a stallion.]] Daenerys eats the raw heart of a stallion before the eyes of the ''[[dosh khaleen]]'', the Dothraki wise women, and names her unborn son [[Rhaego]] in honor of her late brother Rhaegar. The Dothraki crones prophesy that Daenerys's son will be the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]], the "''khal'' of ''khals''" who will unite the Dothraki into a single horde that will overrun all the lands of the world."[[A Golden Crown]]"  Viserys is overcome with jealousy that Daenerys has won the love of the Dothraki. When he attempts to steal her dragon eggs to buy his own army, Jorah stops him, prompting Viserys to taunt Jorah with what he perceives as Jorah's intentions toward his sister. Later, Viserys arrives drunk at the feast and draws his sword, demanding that ''Khal'' Drogo pay the agreed price for Daenerys by providing troops for the invasion of Westeros; he wants his crown or he will take Daenerys back. When he threatens Daenerys and her unborn child, Drogo executes Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head, "a crown for a king." Unphased, Daenerys notes that Viserys was not a true dragon, as fire cannot kill a dragon.  [[file:Drogo Dany Season 1.jpg|thumb|Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to take the Iron Throne.]] Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to invade so their son might claim the Iron Throne, but the Dothraki do not trust ships and water their horses cannot drink. Now that Viserys is dead, Drogo does not feel inclined to honor the bargain. A [[wineseller]] attempts to poison Daenerys to fulfill Robert's orders. She is rescued by Jorah, who initially intends to drink the wine to prove a point, but then offers it knowingly to the wine-seller himself, and Rakharo. Following the assassination attempt, Drogo reverses his decision and swears that he will lead his forces across the Narrow Sea and seize the Seven Kingdoms in blood and fire."[[You Win or You Die]]"  To raise funds to hire the ships necessary for this endeavor, Drogo leads his ''khalasar'' into the lands of [[Lhazar]], the 'lamb-men'. They seize loot and slaves that they can sell. Daenerys is appalled at how the Dothraki treat their prisoners, particularly the women, and wins them better treatment. One of Drogo's riders, [[Mago]], objects and challenges Drogo to combat. Drogo easily slays him but sustains a chest wound. One of the women Daenerys has saved, [[Mirri Maz Duur]], tends to the injury."[[The Pointy End]]" [[File:Drogo's fall.jpg|thumb|Daenerys orders Mirri to be brought to her after Drogo's fall.]] The ''khalasar'' marches southwards to the edge of a great wasteland, but Drogo's wound festers, and he falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the Dothraki. Duur continues to treat him but thinks his wound is fatal. Daenerys convinces her to employ magic to save Drogo's life, which the other Dothraki object to. However, Duur undergoes [[blood magic]], stating that only life pays for life. She then begins chanting, ordering Daenerys out of the tent, as Mirri cuts the [[red]]'s throat. Ser Jorah kills one of Drogo's [[bloodrider]]s, [[Qotho]] when he tries to intervene. Daenerys is injured in the altercation and goes into labor. Jorah takes Daenerys to Duur for treatment, as the Dothraki midwives believe Daenerys to be cursed. The ''khalasar'' then separates due to Daenerys and Drogo's indisposition."[[Baelor]]" [[File:Daenerys and Drogo 1x10.png|thumb|Daenerys discovers Drogo.]] According to Duur, the child is stillborn and deformed, with leathery scaled skin, wings and a stomach filled with grave-worms. Duur saves Drogo's life, but leaves him in a vegetative state. Duur admits she did this deliberately in revenge for the sacking of her village. The ritual that saved Drogo drew its power from the death of Daenerys's son, causing her child's stillbirth and monstrous appearance. Daenerys is distraught. [[File:Dany kills Drogo Fire and Blood.png|thumb|Daenerys ends Drogo's misery.]] Distressed by the lifelessness of Drogo, Daenerys tries to stir any sign of life in him but cannot. She is forced to accept he will never truly be alive again, remaining in a vegetative state, and must smother him with a pillow to end it. She constructs a funeral pyre for his body. She places her dragon eggs on it and ties Duur to the Drogo's funeral pyre, to be burned alive in revenge. Jorah believes that she means to die and tries to persuade her not to.  [[File:Daenerys_and_dragon.jpg|thumb|Daenerys with one of her newly-hatched dragons.]] Daenerys gives a speech to those of her ''khalasar'' who are left. She tells them that they are free to go, but if they stay with her she will lead them to a great destiny, then she steps into the blaze. The following morning it is revealed that she has survived, and three newly-hatched dragons are clinging to her body, the first three dragons in the world in a century and a half. Jorah and the remaining Dothraki fall to their knees, proclaiming Daenerys their queen and leader."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]=== Daenerys leads the remnants of her ''khalasar'' across the [[Red Waste]], hoping to find shelter in the far lands of the east. She tries to feed her newborn dragons, but they refuse the raw meat she offers. She regards the dragons as her sons.[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/daenerys-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen, Daenerys Targaryen entry] The mare Drogo gave her as a wedding gift dies of exhaustion and Daenerys decides to send her three bloodriders, Rakharo, [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Aggo]] and [[Kovarro]], with their remaining horses to explore in three separate directions, knowing that they are her last hope. She then stares at a red comet in the sky above (elsewhere, at [[Winterfell]], [[Osha]] believes this comet is, in fact, an omen for the dragons owned by Daenerys)."[[The North Remembers]]" [[File:Daenerys 202.jpg|thumb|Daenerys awaits for her blood-riders in the Red Waste.]] Daenerys and her ''khalasar'' lie exhausted in the heat, their water dwindling as they wait for the return of her blood-riders. Rakharo's horse returns riderless and Ser Jorah Mormont discovers his head and severed braid in its saddlebag. He surmises that Rakharo was caught and killed by a rival ''khalasar''. Irri is devastated by the death and believes the mutilation will prevent Rakharo from entering the [[Night Lands]], the Dothraki land of the dead. Daenerys promises to hold a funeral for Rakharo and burn his body, allowing him to join his ancestors in the Night Lands."[[The Night Lands]]"  Aggo's fate is unknown, but Kovarro returns with an invitation from the great city of [[Qarth]]. Daenerys leads her people there, and is disappointed at the lukewarm reception she receives. She is denied entry by the ruling council, the [[Thirteen]], unless she shows them her dragons, which she refuses to do. When it seems she will be turned away, the Qartheen dignitary [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] vouches for her and her people, against the order of the [[Spice King]]."[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]" [[File:205 TGOH.jpg|thumb|Daenerys witnesses the tricks of Pyat Pree.]] Daenerys and her surviving people are made guests in Xaro's lavish home. She begins to teach her dragons to cook and eat their own meat, and slowly begin breathing fire on command. She suggests to [[Doreah]] that she use her skill as a lover to find out more about Xaro, who happily agrees. Their host holds a reception for Daenerys and she is introduced to [[Pyat Pree]] of the [[Warlocks]] of [[Qarth]]. He demonstrates his magic by replicating himself and invites her to visit his order at the [[House of the Undying]].  Xaro suggests that Jorah has feelings for Daenerys, but she denies this. Xaro shows Daenerys the [[Valyrian stone]] vault that guards his fortune and offers to fund her return to Westeros in exchange for her hand in marriage. He relays news of the [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|death of King Robert Baratheon]]. Daenerys seeks the council of Jorah. She is eager to seize the opportunity, but he counsels against entering Xaro's debt. He reveals the depth of his feeling for her and his hope for the ruler that she will become. She agrees to take the harder path that he suggests but does not acknowledge his affection."[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"  Later, Daenerys tries to negotiate with the Spice King for ships to return to Westeros. However, he considers it to be too risky an investment ‚Äì considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in Westeros ‚Äì and she receives nothing. She states that she will take what is hers, but the Spice King remarks she will have to do it without his ships. [[File:DanyDiscoversDeadPeopleSeason2.png|thumb|Daenerys returns to find her ''khalasar'' slain.]] Daenerys unsuccessfully appeals to more of the merchant nobles of Qarth to lend her ships. After the meeting, she returns to Xaro's home, to find that it has been attacked; half of her men have been brutally murdered, Irri is dead, and Doreah and the dragons are missing. Unbeknown to her, Doreah has taken her dragons to the House of the Undying, due to an alliance with Xaro and Pyat Pree."[[The Old Gods and the New]]" [[File:Thrones S02E07.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is left terrified by Pyat Pree.]] Xaro hosts a council of the Thirteen so Daenerys can appeal to them for aid. During the meeting, Pyat Pree reveals that he was responsible and Xaro announces his intention to seize control of the city, as the new King of Qarth. The warlock uses his magic, creating thirteen duplicates to murder the rest of the Thirteen. Daenerys flees, but Pyat Pree appears to them, only to be stabbed through the back by Jorah. The stabbed Pyat is revealed to be another one of the duplicates. He repeats his invitation to Daenerys, telling her that her children are at the House of the Undying."[[A Man Without Honor]]"  They take refuge in a disused courtyard, where Jorah advises Daenerys to leave her dragons and flee Qarth, as he has recently booked passage to [[Astapor]]. She insists on attempting to reclaim them and asks Jorah to lead her to the House of the Undying, without knowing what lies in wait."[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"  Daenerys arrives at House of the Undying and is magically separated from Jorah and Kovarro. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. [[File:Dany_Drogo_with_Rhaego_Valar.jpg|thumb|Daenerys experiences a vision of her deceased husband and stillborn-son.]]She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. First the snowy, ruined [[Great Hall|throne room]] of King's Landing where she turns away from the Iron Throne. She then walks through the gates of the [[Wall]] surrounded by more snow, and into Drogo's tent. She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son Rhaego. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching Rhaego's hair. [[File:Daenerys_and_dragons_2x10.png|thumb|Daenerys and her dragons use fire to kill and escape Pyat.]]She returns to the room with many doors and finds her dragons chained to a pedestal in front of her. Pyat Pree appears and explains that she and her brood are the sources of his restored magic. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. However, the young queen is unconcerned and simply regards Pree with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word: "Dracarys"; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and Pyat Pree is incinerated.  Daenerys knows that Xaro has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds Doreah in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. On her orders, Doreah and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from Xaro's household to buy a ship. On Jorah's orders, the Dothraki seize Xaro's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons."[[Valar Morghulis]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]=== [[File:Dany_Drogon_Jorah_S3_Ep1.jpg|thumb|Dany tends to Drogon, now the size of a small dog.]] Following their journey from Qarth, Daenerys's ship, [[Balerion (ship)|Balerion]], arrives at the city of Astapor in [[Slaver's Bay]]. By then, Daenerys's dragons had grown to the size of small dogs. While these dragons were now capable of hunting fish for themselves, they are still not large enough to be used as weapons of war to invade Westeros. Thus, Daenerys needs an army. While the [[Unsullied]], the elite warrior-[[eunuchs]] produced in Astapor, are regarded as some of the finest soldiers in the world, Daenerys knows that their being [[Slavery|slave]]-soldiers would become problematic in Westeros, where slavery is outlawed. However, Jorah convinces Daenerys that she has no choice but to settle for this solution since she has no other means of acquiring an army. While Daenerys considers expanding her tiny Dothraki ''khalasar'', most of whom have become seasick since the Dothraki have never traveled on ships before, Jorah explains that the Dothraki would only join her if she were strong."[[Valar Dohaeris]]"  Upon arriving in Astapor, Daenerys is given a tour of the Unsullied barracks by the Unsullied's owner, [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]], with his slave girl [[Missandei]] translating his [[Low Valyrian]] into the [[Common Tongue]] of Westeros for Daenerys. Since Kraznys does not know that Daenerys understands Valyrian, he frequently insults her. [[File:Missandei as Kraznys translator.png|thumb|Daenerys is told of the Unsullied regime.]] Throughout the tour, Kraznys explains that the Unsullied were trained for battle from the age of five and that only one in four recruits survived the training. He also demonstrates that the Unsullied do not fear pain or death by slicing off the nipple of one soldier, much to Daenerys's disgust. This soldier not only shows no sign of pain but even thanks his slave master for the opportunity to serve him. Daenerys also learns that the Unsullied are trained not to show mercy or weakness by killing a newborn slave child in front of its mother at the end of their training. While Daenerys is outraged by this, she still asks Kraznys how many Unsullied are available. She is told that there are eight thousand soldiers for sale and that she has until the next day to make a decision.  En route back to their ship, Jorah recommends that Daenerys purchase the Unsullied, arguing that under her command, these slave soldiers will have a far better quality of life serving her than they would under Kraznys and his ilk. Daenerys is distracted by a playing [[Warlock (Valar Dohaeris)|child]] who follows her and Jorah. However, neither of them noticed a hooded man, armed with a dagger, following them. The child offers Daenerys a gift, a wooden ball, gesturing for her to open it. [[File:Barristan meets daenerys.png|thumb|Barristan swears fealty to Daenerys.]] As she does, the hooded stranger knocks it out of her hand. In response, Jorah grabs the stranger, and in their struggle knock Daenerys to the ground. The ball then cracks in half, releasing a [[manticore]]. Before the creature can harm Daenerys with its lethal sting, the stranger, revealing himself to be Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], kills it with his dagger. Meanwhile, the child hisses in a reptilian manner and uses magic to escape. Ser Barristan quickly identifies himself as one of [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]'s [[Kingsguard]] and begs her forgiveness for failing House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion. In return for his wrongs, he offers to serve in her Queensguard, which she accepts.  [[File:Danywater.png|thumb|Dany offers water to a dying slave.]] The next day, Daenerys, accompanied by Jorah and Barristan, walks along a sea wall known as the "[[Walk of Punishment]]." Here, any slave who shows insubordination is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public, as a warning to all other slaves. When Daenerys asks for water to give to a condemned man, Jorah reminds her that this man has been sentenced to death. Nonetheless, Daenerys offers condemned man water, but he refuses to drink, saying that he just wants to die. Jorah tells her that if she wants to win the Iron Throne, she must take it, "That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done," but Daenerys responds, "The blood of my enemies. Not the blood of innocents."  Later, Daenerys continues her negotiations with Kraznys over her planned purchase of the Unsullied. During the meeting, Daenerys announces that she would take all 8,000 Unsullied soldiers, including those in training. Kraznys initially dismisses her offer and instead offers to sell her one hundred soldiers. Daenerys then offers to sell him one of her dragons."[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"  In the end, Daenerys reaches an agreement with Kraznys to sell her biggest dragon, Drogon, for all of the Unsullied soldiers. Jorah and Selmy object to this deal on the grounds that her dragons are key to winning the Iron Throne. However, Daenerys appears to brush away their concerns and accepts the transaction, and also takes Missandei as a token of faith. Upon leaving the meeting, she scolds Jorah and Selmy for criticizing her decision in public.  Daenerys also asks Missandei for her name and whether she has any living family, but Missandei responds that she does not. Daenerys warns her that she was heading to war, she may be killed and fall sick and die. In response, Missandei recites the Valyrian aphorism: "Valar morghulis," which translated into the Common Tongue as "all men must die." Daenerys then realizes that Missandei actually knows High Valyrian, and also adds that "we are not men."  On the day of the exchange, the slave masters and Kraznys, along with the 8,000 Unsullied warriors, meet with Daenerys to complete the deal. Daenerys hands the chained Drogon to Kraznys, who is hostile towards his slave master. Kraznys then gives her the golden whip, the symbol of ownership over the Unsullied. After finalizing the transaction, Daenerys tests her new powers by ordering the Unsullied, in Valyrian, to march forward and then halt. This shocks everyone including Jorah and Barristan, who did not know that she spoke Valyrian. [[File:Dany Season 3 Ep 4 Army.png|thumb|Daenerys takes command of the Unsullied.]] Kraznys then complains that Drogon did not obey his command, to which Daenerys angrily retorts Drogon does not obey him because he is not a slave; Kraznys is both stunned to learn she speaks fluent Valyrian and horrified to realize Daenerys understood his derogatory comments and insults about her the whole time, merely feigning ignorance to lull the Astapori into a false sense of security. She then orders the Unsullied to kill all the slave masters and free all the slaves in Astapor, but to hurt no innocent people. When a panicking Kraznys desperately shouts for someone to kill her, Daenerys orders Drogon to burn Kraznys alive."[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"  [[File:Dragons_S3E4.jpg|thumb|Daenerys marches forward with her army and Dragons.]] With the Unsullied under her command, Daenerys sacks Astapor with little resistance. Once it is done, she addresses all of her Unsullied warriors and tells them they are now free. She also gives them the option of leaving unharmed or fighting under her command as free men. At first, the Unsullied remain quiet, not knowing what to do with their newfound freedom. however, one Unsullied soldier begins to beat his spear against the ground, signifying his allegiance to her. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit shortly thereafter. Now in command of an army of free men, Daenerys marches forward with her new army while her dragons fly overhead and roar triumphantly. [[File:Dany Kissed by Fire.png|thumb|Daenerys rallies her Unsullied.]] During their journey to [[Yunkai]], the next great city of [[Slaver's Bay]], Daenerys orders the Unsullied to elect a commander from their own ranks. The officers ultimately choose [[Grey Worm]] who, like all Unsullied, was given the name of a type of vermin. When Daenerys instructs the Unsullied to go back to their own names or pick new ones they like, Grey Worm elects to keep his, as it was the name he had when Daenerys Stormborn set him free."[[Kissed by Fire]]"  While Daenerys and Barristan are confident that they can conquer Yunkai since that city only bred sex slaves, Jorah expresses his concerns that the city's defenders will not fight them on the battlefield but will rather strengthen their position behind the walls and utilize guerrilla tactics against her army. He also views the Yunkai campaign as a distraction from their main goal of taking Westeros. Daenerys is, however, adamant on freeing the slaves of Yunkai, who number in the hundreds of thousands."[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"  She orders Grey Worm to send a messenger to the city, and inform Yunkai's slaver rulers that they must either surrender or suffer [[Sack of Astapor|the same fate as]] [[Astapor]]. Daenerys holds an audience with the Yunkish herald, [[Razdal mo Eraz]], who is one of the ruling "[[Wise Masters]]" of Yunkai. Razdal attempts to discourage Daenerys from attacking his city by claiming that numerous armies throughout history had tried and failed to conquer it. However, Daenerys is undaunted and comments that a hard-fought battle will give her Unsullied much-needed practice. Razdal then attempts to bribe her by providing her with the gold and ships needed to transport her army to Westeros. In exchange, Daenerys will have to leave Yunkai in peace. [[File:Daenerysyunkai.jpg|thumb|Daenerys gives Razdal an ultimatum.]] In response, Daenerys makes a counter-offer: she will spare the lives of Razdal and the slave-masters of Yunkai if every slave (men, women, and children) in the city were set free, and given as much food, clothing, and property as they could carry in payment for their services. She threatens to show no mercy if Yunkai rejects her offer. Razdal is offended by Daenerys's demands and threatens to use Yunkai's "powerful friends" to destroy her.  As a result of Razdal's actions, Daenerys's dragons make threatening gestures toward him. When Razdal protests that he had been promised safe conduct, Daenerys responds that her dragons made no such promise and they take offense to him threatening their mother. Razdal is also unable to reclaim the chests of gold he had brought with him. Following his departure, Daenerys orders her knights to find out more about Yunkai's "powerful friends" before she decided to attack the city.  They eventually discover that these "powerful friends" are the [[Second Sons]], a professional [[Mercenary|mercenary company]]. While there are only 2,000 of them, the Second Sons are armored and mounted, enough to cause trouble for the Unsullied. Daenerys tells Barristan to organize a meeting with the Second Sons' captains, saying that men who fight for gold "can't afford to lose to a girl." [[File:GoT S3 Second Sons.jpg|thumb|Dany meets with the Second Sons.]] Daenerys meets with the Captains [[Mero]], a [[Braavos]]i who is also known as the Titan's Bastard, and [[Prendahl na Ghezn]], a Ghiscari, and Prendahl's underling [[Daario Naharis]]. During the proceedings, Mero insults Daenerys by likening her to a whore and touches Missandei inappropriately. Prendahl and Mero refuse Daenerys's offer of an alliance, pointing out they will not get their rewards until she reclaims the Iron Throne. In response, Daenerys replies that she had no army a fortnight ago and that she had no dragons a year ago. Daenerys gives them two days to make up their mind and sends them away with the barrel of wine which Mero had departed."[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"  After the Second Sons depart, Daenerys instructs Barristan to kill Mero in the event that she had to fight with them. Barristan replies that he would be glad to do so. Later that night, Daenerys takes a bath and is surprised to learn that Missandei speaks nineteen languages. In response, Missandei comments that this shouldn't be that odd since it only took Daenerys a year to gain a reasonable grasp of Dothraki. The ''khaleesi'' bristles at the idea she speaks only ''reasonable'' Dothraki and switches to the language to teach Missandei a lesson, only to have her pronunciation corrected. Suddenly, an Unsullied enters and holds a knife to Missandei's throat, advising the women not to scream. He removes his helmet, revealing himself as Daario. He confesses that his captains want to kill Daenerys, but he disagreed with them. Instead, he beheaded them and shows their severed heads to Daenerys. Shortly after, Daario swears fealty to Daenerys. Thus, Daenerys gains a new ally in her conquest.  For their assault on Yunkai, the new captain Daario suggested attacking the city through its lightly defended back gate. Their plan was to infiltrate the city and open the main gates for the rest of the army to invade. While Ser Jorah was skeptical of the plan, Daenerys and Grey Worm were willing to trust Daario. During the war meeting, Daario attempted to flirt with her. When the battle began, Ser Barristan remained behind to guard Daenerys, fulfilling his duty as a Queensguard. During that night, Jorah, Daario, and Grey Worm infiltrated the city and fought their way through the slave soldiers guarding the city. Within a few hours, Targaryen forces had captured Yunkai."[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"  [[File:Dany_Mother_Mhysa.png|thumb|People of Yunkai celebrate Daenerys as Mhysa.]] The following morning, Daenerys addressed the city's slaves with Missandei serving as her translator. During her speech, Daenerys told the slaves that it was their own choice to reach for their freedom. As a result, the liberated slaves revered Daenerys as their "mhysa", which translated as "mother" from the [[Old Ghiscari]] language. Daenerys mingled with the former slaves who regarded her as a "glimmer of hope" in an increasingly dark world."[[Mhysa]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]=== [[File:Drogon snarls at his mom.jpg|thumb|Drogon snarls at Daenerys.]] Daenerys sits near the sea with her three dragons, each one about the size of a small horse. Daenerys strokes Drogon's head, while Rhaegal and Viserion fight over a dead lamb and Drogon joins the fight. As Daenerys tries to calm him down, Drogon, without warning, snaps at her with a hiss as a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill. Drogon snarls a warning at his mother. This act, that her own children would threaten her, and that they are outgrowing her influence and ability to control them, leaves Daenerys visibly shaken."[[Two Swords]]" [[File:Daariogreywormgamble.png|thumb|Daenerys approaches the gambling commanders.]] Daenerys returns to her Unsullied army to resume the march to [[Meereen]]. She notices Grey Worm and Daario Naharis are absent and sets out to find them after being told they are "gambling." Daario explains they are deciding on which of them will ride up front with her in the vanguard. Frustrated, Daenerys states that the honor goes to Jorah and Barristan as they did not keep her waiting all morning. She orders the two men to ride at the back with the livestock. She also adds that the last man holding his sword shall find a new queen to fight for. Both Daario and Grey Worm instantly drop their swords.  On the road to Meereen, Daenerys speaks with Missandei, who tells her queen that Meereen would be wise to fear her approach. Daario meets them on the cliffside, and Daenerys expresses her annoyance when he shows her flowers he has picked. He reveals that the flowers represent a portrait of the landscape, and serve various purposes, chiefly that knowing her surroundings is important to her strategy. [[File:Daeneryslookdeadslave.png|thumb|Daenerys finds a crucified slave on the road to Meereen.]] The marching army halts and Daenerys goes to the forefront, discovering a slave child nailed to a cross. The child is dead, her hand pointing the way to Meereen, and Jorah tells Daenerys there is one for each mile to the last of the great slave cities, 163 in total. Ser Barristan offers to have outriders go ahead and bury them, but Daenerys refuses, ordering that each of them is buried, and their collars removed, but not before she has looked upon each and every face.  [[File:Dany_and_Huisman-Daario.jpg|thumb|Daario Naharis offers himself as Dany's champion.]] Daenerys and her army eventually arrive at the gates of Meereen as she begins her siege. She is faced with a champions' duel where a riding [[Oznak zo Pahl|knight]] of Meereen challenges her to choose a champion that will fight for her. Daario Naharis, commander of the Second Sons and the most expendable member of Daenerys's entourage, volunteers to be her champion. Once Naharis quickly dispatches the Meereen champion, Daenerys begins her siege of the city by speaking to the gathered slaves and then catapulting the broken chains of those she has freed across the city walls, demonstrating her previous successes. As the slaves examine the broken chains, the [[Great Masters]] looks on, perhaps in fear."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  She sends her Unsullied, led by Grey Worm, to sneak into Meereen and start a slave revolt inside the city. The plan is successful, the slaves rise up against their masters, kill some of them and open the gates to Daenerys. She enters the city as a liberator and the freedmen of Meereen celebrate her arrival by shouting "Mhysa" and throwing their old slaves' collars at her feet. She then has 163 Great Masters killed similarly to how they had murdered the slave children on the road to Meereen, and despite Ser Barristan's council to answer their injustice with mercy, she claims she is "answering injustice with justice." The Great Harpy of Meereen at the apex of the [[Great Pyramid]] is covered with a great Targaryen banner, as Daenerys looks down on the newly liberated city."[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"  [[File:Dany_decision.png|thumb|Daenerys makes her decision to stay and rule in Meereen.]] As a meeting with her advisers and commanders of her forces is held in the highest quarters of the Great Pyramid, she is informed that the Second Sons had taken the Meereenese navy, composed of 93 ships. Although she did not command Daario to take them, she asks if it is enough to take her army to King's Landing. Jorah remarks that even though she might be able to take King's Landing, she wouldn't be able to hold all the Seven Kingdoms. He also tells her that in Yunkai, the Wise Masters re-established slavery and took control of the city, swearing to take revenge against Daenerys. In Astapor, the [[Astapori ruling council|council]] she has left behind to rule has been overthrown by a butcher named [[Cleon]], who named himself "His Imperial Majesty." Daenerys commands everyone except Ser Jorah to leave her, and she questions her ability to rule the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros if she can't even pacify the three cities of Slaver's Bay. Thus she decides to stay in Meereen to gather more knowledge and experience, doing what queens do - rule."[[First of His Name]]"  Daenerys sets up the time to hear petitions from her new subjects. Among the first is a goatherd whose flock were roasted by her dragons; Daenerys orders him paid three times their value. Next is [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], who asks to be allowed to bury his father, one of the 163 Great Masters Daenerys ordered crucified. Daenerys is swayed by Hizdahr's arguments (aided by guilt upon realizing that the elder zo Loraq opposed the crucifixion of the slaves in the first place) and allows the burial. Missandei informs her that there are 200 more supplicants."[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"  Some weeks later, Daenerys is irritated to discover Daario in her private quarters. The mercenary tries to give her flowers, but the queen demands to know what he wants. Daario asks to be allowed to indulge in his only two talents: killing men and loving women. Daenerys counters that the Second Sons are assigned to patrol Meereen and keep the peace, and there are plenty of women in the city that Daario can pursue. Daario says that police work doesn't do the trick and that the only woman he wants isn't interested.  Nonetheless, he confirms that he is sworn to her and that he will continue boring patrol work if that is what the queen wants, and only asks that she occasionally allow him to do what he is actually good at. In response, Daenerys orders him to take off his clothes."[[Mockingbird]]"  The following morning, as Daario leaves, Jorah enters. Jorah observes that he is earlier than most, but later than others. Daenerys brushes off his disapproval and says that she is sending the Second Sons to retake Yunkai. To ensure that slavery is truly dead in that city, Daario is under orders to kill every Wise Master the Second Sons encounter. Jorah protests, warning her that good and evil exists on both sides of every conflict, and that he wouldn't be advising her today if [[Eddard Stark]] had done to him what she is about to go to the Wise Masters. After considering this, Daenerys instructs Jorah to tell Daario that she has changed her mind: his orders are now to accompany Hizdahr to Yunkai so that he can give the Wise Masters a choice: they can live in her new world, or die in their old one. As Jorah leaves, Daenerys says to tell Daario that it was Jorah who changed her mind.  Daenerys is in her chambers with Missandei. The two are talking about Grey Worm and how Missandei caught him gazing while she was bathing naked downstream. Daenerys asks whether Missandei thinks he was spying on her. She says no, and Daenerys mentions that the Dothraki have no taboos against nudity or public love-making. Of course, Missandei is not Dothraki, but she says it doesn't matter, as Grey Worm isn't interested in her - none of the Unsullied desire women. Missandei says he ''was'' interested, surprisingly to both of them. Daenerys inquires whether, when a slave is castrated, the masters take "all of it" - both the "pillar" and the "stones." Missandei says she doesn't know, to which Daenerys asks if she's ever wondered. Thoughtful, Missandei confirms that she has. Later on, Ser Barristan finds out that Jorah was spying on Daenerys."[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"  [[File:DanyJorahExile.png|thumb|Daenerys banishes Jorah from her service.]] Jorah enters the throne room in Meereen. In an audience before her, a seething Daenerys demands an explanation, and Jorah says it is a plot by Tywin Lannister to divide them. Daenerys counters that the pardon was signed the year they met. Asking him whether he claims the pardon was forged, Jorah admits that it was not. He soon confesses to giving [[Varys]] information on Daenerys's activities in [[Essos]]. Daenerys angrily says that Jorah revealing her pregnancy by ''Khal'' Drogo to them led to her [[You Win or You Die|near-poisoning at the hands of a wine merchant]]. Jorah protests that his actions stopped her from being poisoned, but Daenerys retorts this was only because he knew it might be coming. Jorah begs for her forgiveness, but Daenerys rebuffs him, saying he betrayed her, selling her secrets to the man she holds responsible for the death of her family. She spares his life, however, and gives him a day to leave Meereen. She warns that if he is seen in the city after that, his head will be thrown into Slaver's Bay. Jorah is last seen leaving Meereen on a horse.  Daenerys sits in her throne room where she is receiving another day's supplicants. An old man named [[Fennesz]] approaches the throne. Fennesz explains that he was not one of the slaves who toiled away at manual labor, but a well-educated teacher and servant to Master [[Mighdal]], who employed him as a teacher for his own children. He tells Daenerys that Master Mighdal's seven-year-old daughter [[Calla]] admires Daenerys, having learned of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] through Fennesz's teachings. As a servant of Master Mighdal, Fennesz was well-treated and even well-respected in the household, but when Daenerys forcibly freed all of the slaves in the city she did not understand the full-scale complications of suddenly having to care for so many people. Fennesz originally stayed in Master Mighdal's house after she took the city. Mighdal's children begged him to stay, but Mighdal and Fennesz agreed that he must leave rather than face reprisals, forcing Fennesz to become homeless. Daenerys insists that she had established mess halls to feed the freed slaves and barracks to house them. Fennesz says that he has visited these refugee centers and they are not very safe: the young prey on the old, harassing and robbing them. Daenerys insists that her Unsullied will restore order, but Fennesz points out that even assuming that they are able to ensure his physical safety, he has lost his livelihood and his purpose and is too old to start anew. Therefore, he has come to Daenerys to beg her permission to sell himself back to Mighdal. She is shocked that he would ''want'' to be owned as a slave again, as a man might own a goat or a chair.  [[File:Dany promo season 4 ep10 fullsize.jpg|thumb|Daenerys finds difficulty in pleasing her subjects.]] He implores her that the young who can adapt rejoice in her new world, but for those too old to change, there is only fear and squalor. Nor, he says, is he alone: there are many supplicants waiting outside lining up to make similar requests. Daenerys is crestfallen and says she did not liberate the slaves of Meereen only to preside over the very injustice she sought to destroy, but surprisingly relents and admits that freedom means making one's own choices. Therefore she allowed Fennesz to enter into a labor contract with Mighdal, but lasting no more than one year. He earnestly thanks her and leaves. The next supplicant then enters, a shepherd carrying a bundle in his arms. The shepherd timidly approaches and states that he is unable to speak in the common tongue and requires Missandei to translate. Distraught, he tells Daenerys that the "winged shadow" came, placing the bundle on the ground and opening it to reveal charred bones - of a ''human child''. Daenerys's largest dragon, the pitch-black Drogon, has roasted the man's three-year-old daughter [[Zalla]] until this is all that was left of her.  [[File:Dany_dragon_S4.jpg|thumb|Dany chains Rhaegal and Viserion following the disappearance of Drogon. ]] Horrified, Daenerys meets with Missandei and Grey Worm in private to discuss the details of Zalla's death and how to deal with the growing threat the dragons are posing to the people of Meereen. Grey Worm reports that Drogon was last seen flying over the [[Black Cliffs]] three days ago, but he can no longer be found. Realizing that she can no longer control her dragons, Daenerys tells them to head with her to the catacombs under the city. Later, she leads her remaining two dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, into the catacombs, where they are distracted by sheep carcasses. As they are feeding, Daenerys personally locks huge iron collars around their necks, which are secured by heavy chains. She weeps as she does so, as it is symbolically reducing her remaining "children" to chained-up slaves themselves. Daenerys wordlessly leaves and closes the huge stone door to the catacombs behind her as her dragons grow distressed and pathetically call after her when they attempt to follow and realize they are chained in place."[[The Children]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]=== Following the removal of the golden harpy from the top of the [[Great Pyramid]] and the subsequent murder of [[White Rat]], Daenerys is furious. She orders that he be buried with full honors in the [[Temple of the Graces]] as a statement to the [[Sons of the Harpy]], and orders that the Unsullied patrol the streets of Meereen. She later receives Hizdahr zo Loraq's report on the situation in Yunkai. Daenerys is pleased that the Wise Masters will share their rule with the former slaves but refuses to support Hizdahr's concession of allowing the fighting pits to reopen. [[File:Dragons s 5 .png|thumb|Daenerys attempts to comfort Viserion and Rhaegal.]] Later that night, Daario tries to convince her to reconsider, explaining that he was once a slave who earned his freedom in the pits. The skills he learned ultimately led him to the Second Sons and thence to Daenerys. Upon learning that Drogon hasn't been seen in weeks, Daario muses on the possibilities of a dragon queen with no dragons. In response, Daenerys visits Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs where she imprisoned them. To her horror, they try to attack upon hearing her voice and she is forced to flee."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Daenerys leads a council meeting in the pyramid debating the fate of a [[Son of the Harpy]] that Daario and Grey Worm found. Barristan pleads that the man deserves a fair trial while the freed Meereenese slave, [[Mossador]], insists Daenerys put the man to death. [[File:5x02-04.jpg|thumb|Barristan tells Daenerys about her father.]] Daenerys thanks her advisors for their council and dismisses them, but Barristan asks her for a word in private about her father, the "Mad King." Daenerys initially scoffs at Barristan for reminding her of what she considers her enemies' lies. However, Barristan also reminds Daenerys of his past service in her father's Kingsguard and insists that her enemies did not lie. He tells Daenerys about how her father set entire towns and castles ablaze, [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|murdered]] [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|sons]] in front of their [[Rickard Stark|fathers]], and burned men alive with [[wildfire]], laughing as they screamed. All of this led to a [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] that killed every Targaryen save for her and Viserys. Daenerys is visibly shocked but assures Barristan that she is not like her father. Barristan agrees, but he still warns her that the Mad King gave his enemies the justice ''he'' thought they deserved, and each time it made him feel powerful and right until [[Sack of King's Landing|the very end]]. Daenerys promises not to have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.  [[File:Dany_House_white_and_black.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is escorted away from the riots by the Unsullied.]] Later, Mossador goes against Daenerys's order and executes the man, angering Daenerys. She decides to sentence Mossador to death, stating that killing the Son of the Harpy broke the law. A crowd gathers to witness Mossador's execution and Daenerys tells the crowd that when she conquered Meereen she promised freedom and justice, but one cannot exist without the other. Daenerys is escorted away by the Unsullied when riots break out between the freedmen and the masters. [[File:House of black and white drogon dany.jpg|thumb|Dany is reunited with Drogon.]] Daenerys retreats to her pyramid where she wants to spend time alone. She steps out onto her balcony and finds Drogon atop the Great Pyramid. Daenerys is happy to see him and tries reaching out for him, which she hadn't done since the start of her reign over Meereen, but he flies away. Daenerys is left heartbroken as she gazes at Drogon from the distance."[[The House of Black and White]]"  [[File:The Sons of the Harpy 06.jpg|thumb|Dany speaks with Ser Barristan about Rhaegar.]] Daenerys looks down at the streets below from her royal apartment in the Great Pyramid. Ser Barristan arrives and shares a story of how he and Rhaegar used to leave the Red Keep and mingle with the common people on the streets. Daenerys then learns the truth that Rhaegar never loved killing as Viserys once told her before, but that he loved singing and was great at it. Barristan soon tells her that one time he and Rhaegar spent the money Rhaegar earned at a minstrel to get horribly drunk and Daenerys laughs. Daario arrives telling her that Hizdahr is in the throne room awaiting her. Daenerys asks Barristan if he‚Äôll be joining them, but Daario assures her that he has her well protected, despite claiming she could easily defend herself against Hizdahr. Daenerys then gives Barristan the day off, cheerfully telling him to make some music in the city below. In the throne room, Daenerys hears Hizdahr plead again to reopen the fighting pits of Meereen, but she refuses. Hizdahr rationally argues that the fighting pits provide a great spectacle that has always been enjoyed by both the masters and slaves, and is one of the few things that can bring the city together. Daenerys does not interrupt him this time as he continues to offer his proposal."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Daenerys is devastated upon learning of Ser Barristan's untimely death at the hands of the Sons of the Harpy, having lost another one of her most trusted advisers, and grieves over his corpse in the throne room. Upon the suggestion of Daario, Daenerys decides to round up each of the leaders of Meereen's noble families, including Hizdahr zo Loraq.  [[File:Dany-Kill the Boy.jpg|thumb|Daenerys burns a Great Master.]] Bringing the eight of them down to the catacombs where Viserion and Rhaegal reside, Daenerys, with the enforcement of the Unsullied, forces the leaders forwards towards the dragons until [[Great Master 1 (Kill the Boy)|one]] of them is burned alive and then brutally torn apart. Drawn into Daenerys's debate between mercy and revenge, Missandei advises her queen to trust the decision that she alone sees. Taking this advice, Daenerys approaches Hizdahr in his cell, admitting her mistake of refusing to open the fighting pits. Daenerys, in order to secure her bondage with the noble people of Meereen, decides to wed herself to Hizdahr, although she makes it clear that she will be the one in control."[[Kill the Boy]]"  Later, while in bed with Daario, Daenerys reassures him that her marriage to Hizdahr is purely political in order to maintain peace. Daario hints at jealousy and asks if Daenerys would marry him instead, but Daenerys, who would like nothing less, is forced to refuse him.  [[File:The Gift 09.jpg|thumb|Dany views the fighters training for Daznak's Pit.]] To everyone's surprise, Daenerys and Hizdahr appear in one of the fighting pits to watch the opening of the games, though Daenerys is visibly uncomfortable at the violent butchery before her, and gets up to leave, she is convinced to stay by Hizdahr. While arguing with him, another fighter emerges into the pit and proceeded to overpower the other participants, knocking them down one by one using non-lethal means that caused Daenerys to become intrigued by this newcomer. When the fighting is over, the surviving fighter reveals himself as Jorah, but Daenerys, who still hasn't forgiven him, orders him taken away. However, Jorah shouts out that he has brought Daenerys a gift. Jorah's companion enters the arena and introduces himself to Daenerys as [[Tyrion Lannister]]."[[The Gift]]"  Daenerys has both Tyrion and Jorah brought before her inside the Great Pyramid. Though she had doubts about the Lannister's claimed identity, she lets him try and talk her out of executing Jorah. On Tyrion's advice, she spares Jorah's life and banishes him from Meereen again (he counseled that she should not kill those devoted to her, but also that Jorah could not be present should she ever claim Westeros).  [[File:TyrionandDaenerys.jpg|thumb|Daenerys asks Tyrion Lannister to be her adviser.]] Later, over wine, Daenerys and Tyrion speak about their families and past. Daenerys is still thinking about executing Tyrion, mostly as revenge against the Lannisters for betraying her family, but decides not to when she sees Tyrion's indifference to death. Tyrion warns her that the noble families of Westeros are too busy fighting the game of thrones or exhausted to help her reclaim the Iron Throne, and suggests that she consolidate her power in Meereen and build a new kingdom for herself. Daenerys says she'll only stay in Meereen long enough to stabilize the situation and likens Westeros's game of thrones to a spinning wheel, with the Great Houses as spokes. Tyrion dismisses her idealism, noting that others have tried to stop the wheel, but Daenerys firmly declares that she intends to ''break'' the wheel, not just stop it. She then informs Tyrion that she will take him on as an advisor, but confiscates his wine ‚Äì she needs him to communicate in complete sentences."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  Attended by Tyrion Lannister, Missandei, Hizdahr zo Loraq, and Daario Naharis. Daenerys sits in the royal box at the Daznak's Pit and watches to crowd; they are silent. Hizdahr tells her to clap her hands, which she does, beginning the [[Fighting pit#Great Games|Great Games]]. She then notices Jorah in the array of fighters, who gives the traditional dedication to her and manages to be the last fighter standing. At this moment, Jorah suddenly hurls a spear at the royal box ‚Äì embedding itself in a Son of the Harpy sneaking behind Daario. Suddenly, Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves on every level of the arena and begin slaughtering collaborating Masters and freedmen alike ‚Äì Hizdahr included. Jorah and Daario evacuate Daenerys from the royal box, while Tyrion rescues Missandei. Finding the exits blocked, the group makes a stand in the center of the Pit with the remainder of the Unsullied defenders. Seeing they are hopelessly outnumbered, Daenerys takes Missandei's hand and closes her eyes, ready to face her death.  [[File:Dany climbs on drogon.jpg|thumb|Daenerys climbs on Drogon.]] At that moment, a draconic screech pierces the air, and Drogon descends upon the arena, flying out of a giant flame burst. Many of the Sons scatter in terror as Drogon bites and mercilessly burns the nearest ones to death. The Sons rally enough to attack Drogon with spears, which Daenerys hastily makes an effort to remove. Trying to get Drogon out of the Sons' range, Daenerys climbs atop his back and bids him to fly, becoming the first Targaryen [[dragonrider]] in over a century. The Sons of the Harpy temporarily routed, Daario, Jorah, Missandei and Tyrion look on in astonishment as Drogon, with Daenerys on his back, soars away."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[File:Khalessi captured by Dothraki s5.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is surrounded by a ''khalasar''.]] Later, Daenerys finds herself far away from Meereen, atop an impressive hill in a sea of green grass. Drogon is still recovering from his wounds and is uninterested in flying back. Unfortunately, he's also not interested in finding them any food. Daenerys wanders away to find something for them but is shocked to see a trio of Dothraki bloodriders emerge. Within minutes, an entire ''khalasar'' has her surrounded. Understanding what might happen to her, she quickly removes a ring and drops it in the grass, determined to leave a trail."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]=== Now a prisoner of the ''khalasar'', Daenerys is brought before their leader, ''Khal'' [[Moro]], enduring remarks about her appearance from her captors. Out of jealousy, Moro's wives suggest killing Daenerys, though he repeatedly ignores them. Daenerys reveals her identity, but Moro laughs off her titles, saying she is nothing more than his bed slave. Daenerys refuses, revealing herself as the widow of ''Khal'' Drogo. As it is forbidden for a ''khal'' to sleep with a widowed ''khaleesi'', Moro has a change of heart, cuts her free and promises no one will touch her. A grateful Daenerys promises to reward him with more horses if she is returned to Meereen, but Moro informs her that she will be escorted to the Temple of the ''dosh khaleen'' in Vaes Dothrak, a home for other widowed ''khaleesi''."[[The Red Woman]]" [[File:Oathbreaker 19.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is brought to the Temple of the Dosh khaleen.]] Daenerys eventually returns to Vaes Dothrak and arrives at the Temple of the ''dosh khaleen''. Inside, the other widowed ''khaleesi'' strip her of her clothing and jewelry and give her traditional Dothraki clothing. She attempts to intimidate them with her name and titles, but their [[High priestess of the dosh khaleen|leader]] lectures her on how Daenerys believed ''Khal'' Drogo would conquer the world with her at his side, just as they all believed the same of their own husbands before they were slain. Daenerys is then informed that she had violated Dothraki law by not immediately joining the ''dosh khaleen'' after Drogo died, and her fate will be decided soon by the ''khals'' at the ''[[khalar vezhven]]''."[[Oathbreaker]]"  The [[High priestess of the dosh khaleen|high priestess of the ''dosh khaleen'']] introduces Daenerys to the other ''khaleesi'', some of whom hate her for not being of pure blood. During her time in captivity, Daenerys befriends a young ''khaleesi'' named [[Ornela]], a [[Lhazareen]] girl taken from her village at the age of twelve. The high priestess gives Daenerys permission to relieve herself outside but sends Ornela to escort her. The pair are accosted by Jorah and Daario, who have traveled to Vaes Dothrak to rescue her. She tells them to cancel their rescue plan and proposes a plan of her own. [[File:Book of the Stranger 22.jpg|thumb|Daenerys challenges the ''khals''.]] At the ''khalar vezhven'', Daenerys tells the gathered ''khals'' that none of them are fit to lead the Dothraki. Daenerys declares that she will lead them herself. After a pause, Moro and the ''khals'' burst into laughter. Daenerys reminds them that her husband, in the same temple in which they all now sit, declared that he would lead a Dothraki army across the Narrow Sea to retake the Iron Throne for his ''[[khaleesi]]'' and that all the ''khals'' have done since the raid and plunder of villages in lieu of any meaningful conquest. Disgusted with her insolence, Moro declares that she will be raped by each of the ''khals'', then by all of their bloodriders, and then, if she is still alive, by their horses.  [[File:Daeneryskhalasargaze.jpeg|thumb|Daenerys gazes at the bowing ''khalasar'' and'' dosh khaleen''.]] Daenerys's broad smile deepens at his threats and replies that they won't have to follow her because this is where they will [[Massacre of the khalar vezhven|die]]. She knocks over the braziers at the center of the temple, setting the entire building aflame. The ''khals'' desperately attempt to escape the rapidly spreading fire, only to find the temple's only door barred, the bodies of the two ''khaleen'' guarding it lying dead outside. Moro tries to confront Daenerys a final time, but she pushes the last brazier on him, completing the conflagration. As the flames climb higher, the ''dosh khaleen'' and ''khalasars'' gather in confusion. Eventually, the doors collapse and Daenerys emerges, naked and unburnt. Many of the assembled bows immediately, with the high priestess and the rest of the ''dosh khaleen'' following. Jorah and Daario move to the front of the crowd and bow last."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  The next day, Daenerys formally thanks Jorah for saving her life, but still remarks that he has been banished twice and returned both times, so she is left with a dilemma on what to do with him. She is shocked to learn he has [[greyscale]], feeling responsible for his condition. After Jorah confesses his love to her and prepares to leave, Daenerys tells him to find a cure; that she will need him by her side when she sits on the Iron Throne."[[The Door]]"  On the road back to Meereen, Daenerys stops to outline her plan to Daario for when she returns to the city, asking how many ships would be needed to sail the Dothraki and Unsullied. Daario's estimated figure of a thousand troubles Daenerys, as no one owns a fleet that large. Though the sellsword believes she is a conqueror more than anything else, Daenerys states that she takes what is hers. The conversation ends when Daenerys senses something in the distance and rides ahead to investigate. A few moments later, she returns on the back of a fully-healed Drogon, declaring all of the ''khalasar'' as her bloodriders instead of selecting a select few. She then vows to lead them to conquer Westeros."[[Blood of My Blood]]" [[File:Daenerys returns No One.jpg|thumb|Daenerys returns to Meereen.]] As [[Second Siege of Meereen|Meereen is being besieged]] by a fleet of the Masters' ships, Daenerys finally returns to the city, arriving at the Great Pyramid's balcony on Drogon. She is originally mistaken to be a threat from above by Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm, but her identity is revealed when several Unsullied discover her on the balcony adjacent to the council room."[[No One]]"  The following day, Daenerys and Tyrion discuss a plan to deal with the slaver fleet currently besieging the city. Daenerys declares her plans to "return their cities to the dirt" but Tyrion pleads for diplomacy, begging her not to become like [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]. [[File:Battle of the Bastards 25.jpg|thumb|Daenerys meets with the slavers.]] Daenerys and her entourage then meet with the slave masters [[Razdal mo Eraz]], [[Belicho Paenymion]], and [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]]; representing Yunkai, [[Volantis]], and Astapor respectively. The masters discuss their terms of surrender, announcing they will allow Daenerys and Tyrion to leave the city, while Missandei and the Unsullied will be sold back into slavery, and the dragons will be slaughtered. Daenerys rejects their terms, informing them they aren't meeting for ''her'' surrender, but for ''theirs''.  [[File:Daenerys Targaryen Battle_of_Bastards.jpg|thumb|Dany rides Drogon while destroying the enemy fleet.]] The Masters are bewildered by Daenerys's unwavering confidence until Drogon lands beside her. She mounts her dragon and the two take flight, while Rhaegal and Viserion break free from the catacombs of the great pyramid - all three dragons finally reunited. Daenerys then orders her dragons to burn the slave masters' ships; tilting the negotiating table in her favor. Meanwhile, Grey Worm executes Razdal and Belicho but spares Yezzan to spread tidings of her power. Daario leads the Daenerys's ''khalasar'' to slaughter the Sons of the Harpy; ending the threat of the slave masters and their Harpy allies.  [[File:Yara and Dany make a pact.jpg|thumb|Dany and Yara form an alliance.]] Later, Daenerys and Tyrion meet with the ironborn [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]]. Yara offers to provide one hundred ships to Daenerys if, in return, she helps them defeat their uncle [[Euron Greyjoy]] and recognizes the independence of the [[Iron Islands]]. Daenerys accepts Yara's offer of an alliance and observes that both of their fathers left the world worse than they found it, but Daenerys and Yara are going to leave it better than they found it. She demands that Yara recognize her claim to queenship of the Seven Kingdoms and tells her, "No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping." Yara protests this is the ironborn's way of life, but Daenerys is firm. Yara reluctantly agrees to her terms, and the two Queens make a pact."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  Daario reports to Daenerys that the fleet is nearly ready. He's eager to see how the Dothraki do on the open sea. Daenerys informs Daario he won't be joining them, which Daario interprets to mean that he will go on to seize Casterly Rock to cut off the Lannister retreat. Daenerys clarifies that Daario is to stay in Meereen with the Second Sons, to keep the peace until the city can safely choose its own ruler. Furthermore, she cannot bring her lover to Westeros, as marriage is still her most valuable bargaining chip when considering new alliances. Daario begs her to take him, pointing out that kings have mistresses, and queens should be no different, but Daenerys stands firm. Daario realizes that Tyrion convinced her to leave him, but admits that it is a good move politically. He muses that no woman can take her place, although Daenerys is sure he will have many more lovers. Daenerys assures him that she'll leave specific instructions for him to follow in governing the newly-renamed [[Slaver's Bay|Bay of Dragons]].  After Daario leaves, Daenerys goes to see Tyrion, who tries his best to console her. Daenerys thanks him, but admits that she's not upset about Daario: rather, she was frightened that she was able to easily dismiss someone who loves her unconditionally. Tyrion says that Daario wasn't the first man to love Daenerys, and won't be the last. Daenerys then turns the topic to Tyrion's rule of Meereen in her absence. He responds that he gave up on believing in himself or in anyone and anything else, but that he believes in her. Touched, Daenerys gives Tyrion a pin she had made for him: the brooch of the Hand of the Queen. Tyrion, struck with emotion, proceeds to kneel in front of her [[File:Daenerys Targaryen Sails to Westeros, Season 6 Episode 10 Preview..jpg|thumb|Daenerys sails for Westeros.]] Some time later, Daenerys leads her armada to Westeros. With the [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay]] complete, Daenerys sails the [[Summer Sea]], her three dragons: Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion fly over her assembled armada, composed of the horde of Dothraki, [[ironborn]], [[Dornishmen]], [[Reach]]men, and Unsullied fleet of House Targaryen. Daenerys, clad in Targaryen black, stands on the deck of the flagship with Tyrion, Missandei, and Varys, looking ahead to either the gift of a new ally, or another massive war within House Targaryen for the Iron Throne."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]=== [[File:Dragonstone_ep_Dany_in_sand.jpg|thumb|Daenerys's arrival at her birthplace.]] Daenerys arrives on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] for the first time since she was born, accompanied by Tyrion, Missandei, Varys, and Grey Worm. She wastes no time exploring the home of her ancestors, removing one of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s old banners in the process. After examining the [[Painted Table]] of Westeros, Daenerys asks her Hand when they can begin their [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|conquest]]."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  Later, watching the weather, members of her council comment on how it relates to the night of her birth and the storm that came with it. Contrary to what she would have believed, she says that Dragonstone doesn't feel like home, but Tyrion reassures her that they won't have to stay for long. She then comments on the fact that Cersei only controls parts of Westeros, to which Varys says this is due to the fact that many nobles despise her. Daenerys then grills Varys on his true loyalties, comparing his desire for a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] restoration to that of Viserys, in which she also states that Varys only supported her when it suited him, and followed Viserys until his death. She also questions why he betrayed her father for Robert, to which he explains that he would have been executed if he had not done so and that he obeyed Robert's strength in contrast to Aerys's cruelty (Varys doesn't mention that Robert had rescinded his order that Daenerys be killed before he died). Varys then makes it clear that he is truly a representative of the common people, and that his loyalty to them ultimately outweighs his loyalty to any monarch, though he still believes Daenerys is the one most worth following. Daenerys then requests that Varys make a promise to advise her when she goes wrong, rather than betray her, to which he concedes.  Daenerys is then visited by [[Melisandre]], who is welcomed due to the number of Red Priests who supported Daenerys in Meereen. Melisandre is immediately pardoned for siding with Stannis and explains to Daenerys that she may have something to do with the prophecy of [[The Prince That Was Promised]]. Daenerys points out that she is "no prince", prompting Missandei to explain that, in [[High Valyrian|the language]] Melisandre used, the prophecy is gender-neutral. Melisandre further states that Daenerys has a role to play in the prophecy, as does another - the [[King in the North]], [[Jon Snow]]. Tyrion is surprised and questions Melisandre, confirming she is talking about the Jon Snow who is the illegitimate son of Eddard Stark. When Daenerys asks if Tyrion knows him, Tyrion explains he traveled with Jon to Castle Black. Varys asks about Jon, and Daenerys learns of his role as the King in the North and of unifying the Northerners and the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] against [[White Walkers|a common enemy]]. Clearly intrigued by the sound of this man, Daenerys requests that Tyrion write a letter to Jon, after Tyrion tells her that Jon will prove himself a valuable ally in Daenerys's bid to claim the Iron Throne, particularly as the [[Execution of Eddard Stark|crimes]] [[Red Wedding|committed]] by the Lannisters against [[House Stark|his family]] give him enough reason to want Cersei overthrown, asking him to come to Dragonstone and bend the knee.  [[File:Stormborn Dany's Council.jpg|thumb|Daenerys at her council meeting.]] Daenerys later stops an argument between [[Ellaria Sand]] and Tyrion over [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|the assassination of Myrcella Baratheon]], to which Daenerys replies Ellaria must respect her Hand. She also agrees with Tyrion over Yara's idea to attack King's Landing immediately, and that the Unsullied should attack [[Casterly Rock]] while the Westerosi armies lay siege to the capital. When everyone has left the chamber, she requests an audience alone with [[Olenna Tyrell]]. Daenerys then tells her that she knows Olenna is on her side due to their mutual hatred for Cersei, rather than a love for Daenerys herself. In response, Olenna encourages Daenerys to be a dragon, rather than a "sheep", like the other high lords and ladies."[[Stormborn]]"  When Jon and [[Davos Seaworth]] arrive at Dragonstone, Daenerys sits in the keep's throne room, waiting for them. After their entrance, Missandei speaks Daenerys's name and announces her many titles, which stand in stark contrast to Davos simply announcing Jon as "the King in the North." Initially, Daenerys assumes that he has come to bend the knee to her, as she is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, and declared how Jon's ancestor Torrhen Stark bent knee to the Targaryens and was named Warden of the North, reminding that the eras wherein their Houses collaborated brought prosperity to the Seven Kingdoms. Jon, however, reminds her that any fealty House Stark owed House Targaryen ended when her father murdered [[Rickard Stark|his grandfather]] and [[Brandon Stark (son of Rickard)|uncle]] (though he accepts her apology on behalf of House Targaryen for the crimes committed against the Starks and he agrees she is not to blame for her father's sins) and states that his purpose is different; he has come to ask for her help in the coming fight against the [[Night King]] and his [[Wight|Army of the Dead]], to which Daenerys would also need Jon's help in order to expunge the Night King's army.  [[File:Jon_meets_Dany_Queens_Justice_s7.jpg|thumb|Daenerys meets Jon Snow.]] Daenerys becomes increasingly annoyed by Jon's refusal to bend the knee and tells him that since her marriage to ''Khal'' Drogo, she's been through countless ordeals of every kind, but has lived through all of them and even managed to take advantage of certain situations; all because of her faith in herself. That is the reason she believes that since her birth, she has been destined to rule Westeros. However, Jon insists that her kingdom will be nothing more than a graveyard should the Night King win.  Davos starts stating Jon's own achievements during his time as [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]] up until the moment he was crowned King by the Northmen, all of which Jon has achieved not by virtue of inheritance, as he has none due to being an illegitimate son, but rather, by his deeds and the faith his fellow Northmen have in him whose respect Jon gained as a leader. Both Daenerys and Tyrion notice something off in Davos's speech about Jon "[[Mutiny at Castle Black|taking a knife to the heart]]." As Davos speaks of Jon, it becomes apparent to Daenerys that Jon, like her, did not take power for the sake of taking it and his journey to his present standings was every bit as fraught with sacrifice and hardship as hers.  Tyrion takes up and urges them to kneel before Daenerys and, after the war against Cersei, their combined forces would defend the North. Jon refuses both because it may take longer to win the Iron Throne from Cersei and, by then, it may already be too late as at that point the Night King's army may have already bypassed The Wall and marched further down south into the Seven Kingdoms. Jon also explains that he doesn't know Daenerys at this point, that her claim to the throne rests on her descent from a king his family helped [[Robert's Rebellion|overthrow]] and he was chosen by his people to lead, so he must lead them as well as he can. Daenerys concedes that this is fair but counters by saying that if he insists on that view, she will count him as a rebel against her rule.  She ends when Varys whispers the events of the [[assault on the Targaryen fleet]] by telling Jon that he is not yet in her captivity, leading to Jon and Davos exiting the throne room. Varys then tells Daenerys that Ellaria, the Sand Snakes, Yara and the remaining Greyjoy forces are either dead or captured. She then asks if they have all been taken under control of Euron, the instigator of the attack, unknown of [[Theon Greyjoy]]'s abandonment of Yara and his escape from the attack.  Sometime later, Tyrion talks her into letting Jon mine and make weapons of the dragonglass. He insists that if Jon is to be their ally, some good-willed intent must be shown from their side and as they have no use for the dragonglass, they have nothing to lose by letting Jon have it. When she goes back to Davos's saying of Jon "taking a knife to the heart", Tyrion brushes it off as a tall tale. [[File:Jon and Dany TQJ.jpg|thumb|Daenerys allows Jon to mine dragonglass.]] Daenerys and Jon meet in private at a spot overlooking the sea and the dragons, which roam the skies. She expresses similarities between them in having lost loved ones (Rhaegar and Viserys for Daenerys, Robb, and Rickon for Jon). Daenerys explains that since people once thought dragons were gone for good, they should examine what they believe they know, and Jon realizes Tyrion has been talking to both Daenerys and him. Daenerys reminds Jon she won't let Cersei stay in power and Jon responds he didn't expect she would. When Daenerys also explains she hasn't changed her mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne, Jon says he hasn't changed his mind about refusing to bend the knee either. Both come to a standstill until Daenerys offers to help him mine the dragonglass he needs and provide what he needs to do so. Jon asks her if she believes him now about the army of the dead, to which Daenerys responds by telling him to hurry and begin his work.  Tyrion then informs her of his plan for the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock through a secret passageway he used during his whoring days. However, this leads to the Unsullied ships being burned by Euron, causing them to be trapped at Casterly Rock. Daenerys ultimately loses another ally during the [[sack of Highgarden]], in the forced suicide of Olenna and the loss of the [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] army."[[The Queen's Justice]]"  [[File:Daenerys-Missandei-Spoils-of-War-2.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is informed of Grey Worm and Missandei's relationship.]] Days later, Daenerys strolls around Dragonstone with Missandei at her side, both wondering about the fate of the Unsullied. Missandei reveals to the queen that certain things happened between her and Grey Worm, before they are interrupted by Jon Snow.  [[File:704_-_Cave_Drawings.jpg|thumb|Jon makes Daenerys believe in the White Walkers.]] He leads Daenerys through an underground cave, whose walls are rich in dragonglass. He shows her ancient wall drawings, which were made by the [[Children of the Forest]]. They depict the children themselves as well as the [[First Men]] and how they banded together to defeat their common enemy, the White Walkers. She is awestruck and starts becoming swayed by Jon's sayings, promising to defend the [[North]] with him when he bends the knee. Although he insists his people would never accept a southern ruler after everything they suffered, Daenerys asks him whether his own pride is more important than the lives of the Northmen.  After they leave the cave, Tyrion and Varys deliver news of the Unsullied's incomplete victory at Casterly Rock and the fall of Highgarden. Enraged at the loss of her allies, Daenerys snaps at Tyrion, accusing him of devising soft plans to protect his family and impulsively suggests flying to the Red Keep and burning it to the ground. She then turns her attention to Jon and asks for his advice. He tells her that all her followers saw her accomplish the impossible and believe she can do so yet again. However, using the dragons to destroy the castles and cities of Westeros would make her no different than the ones she is trying to overthrow. [[File:704 Battle of Tumbleton 4.png|thumb|Daenerys burns the Lannister-Tarly army.]] When the combined armies of [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Randyll Tarly]] prepare to finally leave Highgarden, Daenerys's horde of [[Dothraki]] attacks them as they cross the plains of the Reach, with Daenerys herself leading the charge riding on the back of Drogon. The Lannister-Tarly infantry assume an anti-cavalry shield wall, but Daenerys has Drogon blast them with dragonfire, clearing a path through the formation for her warriors to charge. Although the Lannister and Tarly forces fight fiercely and inflict heavy casualties against the Dothraki at first, the combination of dragonfire and cavalry charges overwhelms them, and their formations soon fall apart. Jaime briefly rallies a group of archers to target Daenerys as she dives again, hoping to kill her and leave her forces leaderless, but Drogon pulls up sharply and the arrows glance harmlessly off his scales. Daenerys and Drogon launch dive-bombing attacks from above to destroy the Lannisters' supply convoy, and the Dothraki mercilessly slaughter every fleeing soldier they find. Seemingly out of nowhere, a giant bolt whizzes right past Drogon as he flies and Daenerys immediately heads for the [[scorpion]] to destroy it. Before she can reach it, [[Bronn]] (who is manning the weapon) manages to strike Drogon's wing, causing the dragon to wince in pain and lose his balance.  After plummeting nearly to the ground, Drogon regains his balance right in front of the scorpion and incinerates it with his fire-breath. He then lands on the battlefield and demolishes what's left of the scorpion with an angry swipe of his tail. Daenerys dismounts on the riverbank and tries to pull the bolt out of Drogon's shoulder. While trying to do so, she turns to see a mounted Jaime galloping towards her with a spear in hand. Drogon moves to protect his mother, shielding her behind his head and shooting a line of fire at him, only for Bronn to save him by tackling him off of his horse into the river."[[The Spoils of War]]"[[File:Dany_and_Tyrion_Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180px|Daenerys sentences Randyll and Dickon Tarly to death.]] In the aftermath of the battle, the survivors are rounded up and taken before Daenerys. She claims they've been manipulated by [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and offers them a choice: bend the knee and join her to build a better world with her, or refuse and die. As if to reinforce this point, Drogon roars menacingly from his perch behind Daenerys. Most of the survivors quickly kneel, with the exception of Randyll Tarly and [[Dickon Tarly]]. Randyll refuses to trade his honor for his life, claiming he has chosen his queen. Tyrion suggests she send him to the [[Wall]], but Randyll reminds her that she cannot, as she is not his queen. Dickon follows his father, despite Randyll's protests. Daenerys accepts their choice and sentences them both to death by dragonfire, executing them.  [[File:Jon and Dany Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|Jon and Daenerys discuss Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal.]] Back at Dragonstone, Jon watches as Daenerys lands Drogon in front of him. The dragon approaches Jon, who stands his ground. Drogon allows Jon to touch him, to Daenerys's astonishment. She dismounts, at which point Drogon flies off, and claims that the "gorgeous beasts" Jon sees are her children. Daenerys informs Jon of her victory over the Lannisters and they discuss what is needed to help people. Daenerys asks him what Davos meant by "taking a knife in the heart for his people." Jon avoids discussing his resurrection, claiming that Davos gets carried away, but before Daenerys can press him further, they are interrupted by the arrival of Jorah, who has been cured of his greyscale. Delighted, Daenerys embraces Jorah and introduces him to Jon, who tells him that his [[Jeor Mormont|father]] was a great man.  Inside the Chamber of the Painted Table at Dragonstone, Daenerys holds a meeting with her advisors, as well as Jon and Davos. Daenerys extends her relief to Jon at his discovery that his half-siblings [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Bran Stark|Bran]] are still alive and at Winterfell after years of believing them dead. Jon, having received Bran's warning of the Night King marching towards [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] and fearing that the Night King will make it past the Wall, states that he must go home to Winterfell and prepare to fight the army of the dead. Daenerys questions his ability to do so with the modest amount of men sworn to fight for him, and Jon requests her help once again. She refuses, noting that Cersei wins if she abandons her cause to take the Iron Throne. Unsure of how to proceed, Tyrion presents the idea of bringing evidence of the army of the dead to Cersei, in the hopes of convincing her to join the fight against the White Walkers. Jon decides to lead an expedition north of the Wall to capture a wight and bring it south to King's Landing. Daenerys, at first, doesn't agree with Jon's departure but is convinced by Tyrion's confidence in the mission. [[File:Dany and Jorah Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys bids farewell to Jorah.]] As Jon, Jorah, and their group prepare to depart on boats for [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], Daenerys and her entourage arrive and bid Jorah farewell. Jorah quips that he is used to saying farewell. When Jon and Daenerys bid farewell, he says that there is a chance that he might not return and that she won't deal with the King in the North anymore, Daenerys tells him that she's grown used to him. Then Jon wishes her well in the wars to come. Along with Tyrion, Daenerys watches as Jon, Jorah, and the rest of the party depart on their boats for Eastwatch."[[Eastwatch]]"  Sometime later, Daenerys discusses Drogo, Jorah, Daario and Jon Snow with Tyrion. A concerned Daenerys says that they're heroes who all do stupid, brave things and die. Tyrion notes that all the men she's named have all fallen in love with her. Daenerys dismisses this about Jon, claiming that he is "too little" for her, but Tyrion thinks Jon has feelings for her. When Daenerys clarifies she knows Tyrion is brave, that's why she chose him as her Hand, they discuss Cersei and how to take King's Landing. Explaining fear is all Cersei has, Tyrion tells Daenerys that it made the Lannisters' power brittle. When Daenerys says Aegon got a long way with fear, Tyrion tells Daenerys she needs to be different from who came before her if she wishes to break the wheel. The negotiations with Cersei will be difficult and Tyrion cautions Daenerys that his sister will likely try to provoke her. He lightly admonishes her for losing her temper and burning Randyll and Dickon, but Daenerys says it was necessary. Tyrion believes Daenerys acted too hastily instead of exploring other options and giving the Tarlys time to think. He wants Daenerys to defeat her enemies, as he believes in the world she wants to build. The subject turns to her succession and he notes she told him she can't have children. Daenerys wants to set this discussion aside until after she wins the throne, and leaves.  [[File:706 Tyrion Daenerys Exterior.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys leaves for Eastwatch. ]] Later, she receives a raven from [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] calling for help beyond the Wall. Against Tyrion's advice, insisting Jon knew the risks of the mission and everything they've done will be for nothing if she dies beyond the Wall, and therefore unable to break the metaphorical "wheel", Daenerys flies North with her dragons, leaving her army on Dragonstone.  She arrives in time to save Jon and his party, burning countless wights and landing for them to climb up. The Night King, however, impales Viserion with an ice spear through the throat, killing him. Enraged, Jon sets his eyes on the Night King but as the monster reaches for another spear, he then shouts at Daenerys to leave. Reluctantly, she and the others flee just as the Night King throws another spear at Drogon, which misses, and they return to Eastwatch. Daenerys stands on the Wall with Jorah, who ushers her to leave, but stays, obviously concerned for Jon. When he returns on the horse of [[Benjen Stark]], who sacrificed his life to save him, Daenerys is visibly elated and sees Jon's stab wounds for the first time when they remove Jon's frozen clothes, realizing the truth of what Davos said about him. [[File:A Game of Thrones with Danerys at Jon's Bedside, Episode 6 of Season 7, 'Beyond the Wall'.jpg|thumb|Dany and Jon ally in the loss of Viserion.]] Daenerys sits at Jon's side until he wakes up; a distraught Jon apologizes for Viserion's death, believing it his fault, but Daenerys insisted she needed to see the scale of the threat facing them for herself, "You have to see it to know. Now I know." She reveals that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, promising that they will destroy the Night King forever. Jon thanks her and calls her "Dany", to her amusement, though remembering that is was what her brother Viserys used to call her and she tells Jon that's not the company he wants to keep. Jon then calls her, "My Queen," and pledges fealty to her, moving Daenerys to tears; when she asks what the Northern lords who have sworn to him will make of this choice, Jon gently assures Daenerys that like him, they will come to see her for the good person she truly is. Daenerys tearfully responds that he hopes she deserves it and clasping each other's hands, Jon assures her she does. They share a moment before Daenerys insists Jon rest and she leaves."[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]" [[File:S07E07 Daenerys.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys arrives at the Dragonpit on Drogon's back.]] At the [[Dragonpit]], the various factions meet: Cersei, Jaime, Qyburn and Euron represent the Iron Throne. Jon, Davos, and Brienne represent the North and Daenerys's court. When Cersei demands to know where her rival is, the Dragon Queen makes a suitably dramatic entrance on Drogon's back, with Rhaegal flying overhead.  After making apologies for her lateness, they proceed in getting the meeting on track, Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon try to warn Cersei of the greater threat coming for them all, but she dismisses it as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses. To prove their claims, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] returns with the crate containing the wight, which is worryingly silent. Sandor gets the crate open, but there is still no movement. He finally gives the crate a massive kick, which prompts the [[Captured wight|enraged wight]] to launch itself out and charge toward the nearest target - Cersei, appropriately enough. Visibly horrified, the Lannister queen and her allies recoil in horror as Sandor pulls the wight back on a chain, its claws inches from Cersei's face, and manages to slice the creature in half when it turns to attack him. The assembled look on in shock as the wight's upper half ''still'' moves around. Jon steps forward and picks up the wight's discarded hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros. A horror-struck Jaime asks how many wights are coming, and Daenerys tells him the army of the dead numbers at least 100,000. Euron asks if the wights can swim. When Jon responds, "No," Euron announces to Cersei his intention to withdraw the Iron Fleet back to the [[Iron Islands]]. He declares that he has been over the whole world and has never been terrified until now. On his way out, Euron tells Daenerys to retreat to her island while he returns to his own and to come find him when they are the only two left alive.  Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the Army of the Dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon Snow, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict. [[File:Jon and Dany 707.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys tells Jon of Viserion's sacrifice.]] Meanwhile, Daenerys and Tyrion rip into Jon over his ill-advised action. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill. Jon responds by arguing that while such an attitude may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. Tyrion reluctantly decides that he will go and try to talk some reason into Cersei alone. Daenerys and Jon protest, fearing Cersei may have him killed out of spite, but Tyrion insists it's the only way if they don't want everything they've done to be for nothing and bids them wait.  While Tyrion goes to talk to Cersei, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn, her family became less impressive as the power of the dragons waned, that they became like everyone else. Jon responds that Daenerys is not like everyone else. When Daenerys confides she was made infertile by Mirri Maz Duur, Jon questions this, particularly when she admits it was Mirri Maz Duur who told her she was infertile. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens.  In the Chamber of the Painted Table, Daenerys and her court discuss logistics. It will take the Dothraki a fortnight to reach Winterfell, and the plan is to have Jon and the Unsullied cross the sea by ship and meet them at [[White Harbor]]. Jorah Mormont points out that the North is not really safer for her than anywhere else, as someone with a memory of Robert's Rebellion and an idea of becoming a hero could easily take her out with a single crossbow bolt. He suggests she fly to Winterfell to avoid any potential unpleasantness. Jon counters that Daenerys ride with them so that the North can see her as a liberator and ally. After a moment's consideration, Daenerys decides to sail north with Jon. Jorah, suspecting a different reason for her decision, throws her a look, which she notices but avoids. [[File:Jon enters danys chambers s7 ep7.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys and Jon give in to their feelings.]] Some time after setting sail, Jon knocks on the door of Daenerys's cabin. She answers and meets his gaze without words. After a moment, he enters, and, with their eyes still locked on one another, shuts the door. Unaware of their biological connection to one another, they finally give into the burgeoning passion between them and make love.  Unbeknownst to both of them, Tyrion had also been on his way to speak with his queen, and had seen Jon enter the cabin."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]=== [[File:Dany Jon March to Winterfell Ep.jpg|thumb|Daenerys arrives at Winterfell.]] Upon arrival in the North, Daenerys, Jon, and their combined forces march through Winter town on their way to Winterfell. The townspeople cast her many suspicious looks, and Jon reminds her that Northerners have a long-established distrust of outsiders. Immediately following this exchange, Drogon and Rhaegal fly overhead, startling the townspeople and causing Daenerys to smile proudly. In Winterfell's courtyard, Jon introduces her to Sansa, and the two women exchange a civil but tense greeting. [[File:SANSAJONDANYWINTERFELL.jpeg|thumb|Daenerys sits at Winterfell's high table.]] Later, Daenerys is seated at the high table in the castle's great hall along with Jon and Sansa. Tyrion attempts to calm the slightly hostile Northern lords by telling them that the largest army ever seen has been assembled, but Sansa asks how she is supposed to feed such a force along with two dragons. When she asks what dragons even eat, Daenerys replies, "Whatever they want."  While inspecting the preparations for the coming battle, Daenerys remarks to Jon upon Sansa's apparent dislike for her. While Jon assures her that Sansa wasn't overly fond of him when they were growing up, Daenerys rebuffs him by saying that they don't need to like each other, but she will be respected as queen. Several Dothraki approach the pair and mention that the dragons haven't been eating as much as they normally do. [[File:Dany & Jon S8.jpg|thumb|Jon and Daenerys share a moment.]] Daenerys and Jon come upon the two dragons in a bone pit outside Winterfell's walls. She mounts Drogon, planning to take him for a ride, and suggests that Jon mount Rhaegal. After much trepidation, Jon does so, and the dragons take the pair on a wild ride over the snow-covered landscape, Daenerys being somewhat pleased with Jon's almost instant connection with her dragon. Eventually, they land near a waterfall in an area where Jon used to hunt as a youth. Away from all concerns about the coming battle, Daenerys and Jon share an intimate moment.  Daenerys and Jorah later encounter [[Samwell Tarly]] in Winterfell's library. After praising him for realizing the secret behind dragonglass and curing Jorah of his greyscale, she asks if there is anything she can do to repay him. Sam jokingly asks for a pardon for stealing books from the Citadel and for taking his family's ancestral sword without permission. Upon hearing his surname is "Tarly", Daenerys realizes that he is, in fact, Randyll Tarly's son, and proceeds to tell him the difficult truth that she executed his father and brother for rebelling against her. Sam is speechless for a few moments before asking to leave the library."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]" [[File:Brienne defends Jaime s8 ep2.jpeg|thumb|Daenerys puts Jaime on trial.]] When Jaime arrives at Winterfell, Daenerys is once again seated at the high table with Jon and Sansa. The two women harshly berate the Kingslayer for his past actions and question whether his loyalty to their cause is genuine. Only when Brienne vouches for Jaime does Sansa trust him, and Daenerys allows his [[Widow's Wail|sword]] to be returned to him. [[File:Sansa & Dany S8 E2.jpg|thumb|Daenerys and Sansa discuss Jon.]] Later, Daenerys speaks privately with Sansa, addressing some of the thorny political issues involved in their alliance. Sansa is afraid Daenerys has ulterior motives and that because Jon loves her, he will do stupid things for love. Daenerys assures Sansa this is not the case and confesses her love for Jon, explaining she has had only one goal - retaking the Iron Throne - until she met Jon and now she's in the North helping him fight the Night King and the army of the dead. Although a greater understanding appears to develop between the two women, Sansa remains firm in her conviction that the [[Northmen|Northerners]] will never truly accept an outsider as their ruler again, and bluntly asks Daenerys what her plans for the North are once the dead have been defeated. The awkward moment is interrupted by Maester [[Wolkan]] announcing the arrival of Theon and his men.  When the survivors from Eastwatch bring the news that the army of the dead will be at Winterfell's gates within a day, preparations inside the castle begin to move forward at a feverish pace. Daenerys meets with all the prominent commanders and heads of houses to discuss battle strategy, and later finds herself in the crypts with Jon. While standing in front of Lyanna Stark's statue, Daenerys recounts how everybody told her Rhaegar was decent and kind but that he [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapped]] and raped Lyanna. However, Jon reveals Rhaegar did not rape Lyanna and they were in love. He tells Daenerys the truth about his parentage and she is stunned. She immediately questions the validity of the story. When Jon assures her that it's true, she realizes that Jon actually has a better claim to the throne than she does. Before either can discuss the matter further, a horn sounds three times to signal the arrival of the army of the dead."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"  [[File:Jon & Dany S8 Ep3.jpg|thumb|Jon and Daenerys watch as the battle at Winterfell begins.]] Daenerys and Jon watch with Drogon and Rhaegal from a distance as the Dothraki charge the army of the dead, but when the Dothraki are slaughtered, Daenerys breaks away from Jon's plan to wait for the Night King and attacks the army of the dead with dragonfire. Daenerys and Jon's visibility is cut off when the White Walkers summon a blizzard, however. High in the skies above Winterfell, Daenerys and Drogon are suddenly attacked by the Night King on Viserion, but she is able to evade him. Daenerys and Drogon later knock the Night King off Viserion, and Daenerys has Drogon burn the Night King, though to no avail.  [[File:Jorah's Death S8 EP3.jpg|thumb|Daenerys cries over Jorah's body.]] They escape as the Night King hurls an ice spear at Drogon. When Jon is surrounded by newly risen wights, Daenerys saves him with Drogon, burning through wights and creating a path for Jon to rush into Winterfell to help Bran and stop the Night King. She urges Jon to go and after he runs to stop the Night King, wights climb onto Drogon, and Daenerys falls off while Drogon flies away. Daenerys takes hold of a discarded sword and slays a few wights who come her way or Jorah's. However, she is also protected by Jorah, who dies defending her, leaving Daenerys sobbing while Drogon wraps around them after the Army of the Dead falls."[[The Long Night]]" [[File:Table S8 EP4.jpg|thumb|Daenerys celebrates Winterfell's victory.]] After the battle, which saw a living victory, Daenerys mourns the dead outside Winterfell, lighting a pyre. She kisses the dead Jorah's forehead and whispers something to him. Daenerys later celebrates at the feast inside Winterfell. [[Tormund]] makes a toast to Daenerys, "To the Dragon Queen!" and Daenerys stands up herself, toasting [[Arya Stark]] as the "Hero of Winterfell." However, despite her initially celebratory mood and the smiles she exchanges with Jon, Daenerys's mood grows downcast when Tormund begins to praise Jon and she finds herself lonely and envious over Jon's popularity with the wildlings, looking around at the groups of people around her.  Daenerys finds Jon in his chambers that night and they kiss, beginning to undress, before Jon stops himself due to learning of their relation. Daenerys laments that she wishes Jon never told her about his true identity because otherwise, she'd be happy. She is afraid others will press his claim and take the throne from her. Jon tries to assure her he doesn't want the throne.  [[File:Jon_&_Dany_S8_EP4.jpg|thumb|Daenerys begs for Jon's secrecy. ]] Daenerys tells Jon it doesn't matter what he wants or how many times he swears fealty to her - he didn't want to be King in the North either. Jon gets on one knee before her and says that he'll refuse the crown because she is his queen. Daenerys begs Jon not to tell anyone else about his parentage, fearing that it will destroy them. Jon insists he must tell his sisters because he owes them the truth about who he is, certain his sisters will keep it secret, everything will work out, and they can all live together. However, Daenerys believes the only way they can live together is if Jon keeps his identity secret. [[File:Dany_Upset_S8_EP4.jpg|thumb|In her anger, Daenerys attempts to avenge Rhaegal's death by killing Euron.]] Daenerys leads a war council for her resumed campaign against Cersei Lannister for the Iron Throne. As her fleet is sailing back to Dragonstone, she rides Drogon next to Rhaegal, when suddenly Rhaegal is shot by three bolts before plummeting into [[Blackwater Bay]]. Euron's Iron Fleet reveals itself from behind Dragonstone's rocks and tries to take down Daenerys and Drogon, but are unable to do as they pull back. Euron instead targets Daenerys's fleet, destroying it and capturing Missandei in the process. On Dragonstone, Daenerys becomes tempted to storm King's Landing. Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys, and Grey Worm parley with Cersei outside the gates of King's Landing, where Cersei executes Missandei in front of them."[[The Last of the Starks]]" [[File:Dany S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|A mournful Daenerys discovers treason in her ranks.]] Back at Dragonstone, a mourning Daenerys refuses to eat and becomes increasingly angered at the rule of House Lannister, as well as becoming increasingly paranoid that her claim to the throne is losing legitimacy. However, her fears are found to be true when she learns through Tyrion that Varys has plotted to betray her and crown Jon in her place, after learning the truth of his parentage from Sansa. Daenerys has Varys brought out onto the shores of Dragonstone, where she sentences him to die by having Drogon burn him, just as she promised him earlier if he were ever to betray her. [[File:Jon & Dany S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Daenerys confronts Jon on his claim.]] Later, when Daenerys and Jon talk, she reminds him of her warning to him about telling Sansa the truth of who he was. Daenerys says Sansa is as responsible for Varys's death as she is. Jon attempts to reassure Daenerys that he doesn't want the crown (having also told Varys he wouldn't take it). Daenerys laments that Jon has the love of the people while she does not - she only has fear. In an effort to compensate, Jon tells Daenerys ''he'' loves her and that she'll always be his queen. Daenerys kisses him and Jon gives into the kiss, but breaks it off due to their blood ties. Daenerys accepts this and resigns herself to being feared.  Tyrion consults with Daenerys, the latter of whom is now ordering Grey Worm and the Unsullied to sack King's Landing. Tyrion is strongly against it, saying that the citizens of the city are not Daenerys's enemy and are innocent. Daenerys counters that the slaves in Meereen turned against their masters and liberated themselves. Tyrion responds that the smallfolk are afraid of Cersei because Cersei will punish any rebellious acts. Daenerys says they are hostages in a tyrant's grip, and Tyrion begs her not to burn the city, or thousands of children will die. Daenerys counters that Cersei is using mercy as a weakness against them but Cersei is wrong, mercy is their strength - her mercy for the future generations of Westeros, not those in the present. In a last-ditch effort to get through to Daenerys, Tyrion bargains one last time: wait for the city to surrender and call off the attack when the people ring the city's bells, indicating the full, unconditional surrender of Cersei and her army. Reluctantly, Daenerys agrees. Before Tyrion leaves, she informs her Hand that Jaime was caught by her men trying to get past their lines. She warns him that the next time he fails her, it will be his very last.  Daenerys attacks Euron's Iron Fleet atop Drogon as the [[Battle of King's Landing]] begins, sinking the fleet and destroying the scorpions. Daenerys then attacks the scorpions stationed across the walls of King's Landing, destroying them all, preventing the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] [[Man-at-arms|soldiers]] from targeting Drogon. [[File:Dany Angry S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Having lost so much, Daenerys succumbs to the Targaryen madness.]] Daenerys destroys the gate and its walls that the [[Golden Company]] guards, killing many of the [[Mercenary|sellswords]] from the debris that falls upon them. This allows the Dothraki, Unsullied, the Northern and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] armies to destroy the remaining sellsword contingent and charge into the city. Overwhelmed, the Lannister soldiers and civilians surrender, ringing the city's bells. However, Daenerys, consumed by grief and anger, instead goes on a rampage, using Drogon to burn King's Landing. The dragonfire also sets off the [[wildfire]] caches placed around the city by her father, the Mad King, [[Wildfire plot|years ago]], leaving the city in ashes. At the same time, her armies, taking their lead from Daenerys, proceed to run riot through the city, killing any Lannister soldiers and civilians they can get their hands on.  [[File:Thrones S08E06.jpg|thumb|Daenerys is hailed by her armies in a ruined King's Landing.]] Thousands of the surrendered soldiers and innocent [[Smallfolk|civilians]] are killed in the firestorm across the city, either from Drogon, Daenerys's soldiers, or collapsing buildings and debris. After the battle, Daenerys orders the captured Lannister soldiers to be executed."[[The Bells]]" "[[The Iron Throne]]"  Daenerys later stands over the carnage and ashes of King's Landing, as she is cheered on by the Dothraki and guarded by the Unsullied. She delivers a speech to her victorious armies, proclaiming that they gave her the Seven Kingdoms and "liberated" the people of King's Landing but declares their war is not over. She will continue to "liberate" the rest of the world as they did for King's Landing, and will "break the wheel" to free it from those whom she perceives as tyrants. Tyrion approaches Daenerys, who confronts him about freeing his brother. She becomes angry after he retorts that she slaughtered a city, and tosses away his Hand of the Queen pin. In return, Daenerys has him arrested. Jon visits an imprisoned Tyrion, who tries to convince a conflicted Jon on what Daenerys has become. He understands Jon loves her, he loves her too, and knows he is asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but it is also the right thing. Tyrion then stresses that Daenerys is now the greatest threat to the people. [[File:Dany Throne S8 Ep6 03.jpg|thumb|Daenerys finally observes the Iron Throne.]] Walking through the charred remains of the throne room, seeing what she saw in her vision in the House of the Undying years ago, with the Iron Throne the only piece completely intact, Daenerys ascends in awe and reaches her hand out to touch one of the snow-covered blades. Before she can sit down, Jon enters and she recounts to him the conquest of her ancestor [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] and how he had the Iron Throne built. Jon confronts her about the many atrocities she committed during the battle; however, she justifies her actions and, despite Jon's pleas for her do so, she refuses to forgive Tyrion and the people of King's Landing. He begs Daenerys to make the people see that they made a mistake, and to make them understand.  Unswayed by Jon's reasoning, Daenerys asserts that they can't hide behind small mercies and the world they need cannot be built by those loyal to the old one. Jon desperately argues that their world must be one of mercy; Daenerys assures him that she is building a good world. Distressed, Jon asks her how she knows it's good and Daenerys confidently asserts that she knows what is good, trying to convince Jon that he does too. Upset, Jon is unconvinced and asks about everybody else who thinks they know what is good, to which Daenerys responds, "They don't get to choose." Daenerys embraces Jon and makes clear her desire for Jon to help her build the new world she envisages and urges him that this is how they break the wheel. [[File:Queen slayer.png|thumb|Dany dies in Jon's arms.]] Jon tells Daenerys that she is his queen, "Now and always." As the two of them share a final kiss, Jon thrusts a dagger into her heart. He catches Daenerys as she falls, blood escaping her nose and mouth, a look of confused heartbreak draws upon her face. As an anguished Jon holds Daenerys, he grieves over her.  Drogon notices Jon laying Daenerys down on the ground and approaches them. Drawing closer, he snarls at Jon before trying to nudge his mother awake. Upon realizing that she is dead, Drogon, roars in rage and grief at Jon before unleashing a jet of fire that melts the Iron Throne. He then carries off Daenerys's body with his claws, flying far off into the distance, never to be seen again.  With House Targaryen legally extinct, the [[Great Council of 305 AC]] decide that the Seven Kingdoms will be an [[Elections|elective]] monarchy under [[Bran Stark|Brandon I]]. Through this elective monarchy, Tyrion fulfills Daenerys's wish of "breaking the wheel", while Jon is exiled to the [[Night's Watch]] in order to avoid a war between the Unsullied and his supporters.  ==Abilities== * '''Extreme heat resistance''' - Daenerys is inhumanly resistant to extreme heat."[[Book of the Stranger]]" * '''Dragonriding''' - Daenerys is a capable dragonrider who uses Drogon as her mount.  ==Personality== ReferencesSection Dialogue a-b-a|Varys|The [[Seven Kingdoms]] need someone stronger than [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] but gentler than [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].

As a child and young woman she was easily cowed by her brother's ambitions and occasional cruel rages. She was also somewhat naive of the world at that point, due to being young and living her life as an exile (with only her petulant brother to rely on for knowledge), but her time amongst the [[Dothraki]] taught her pride, confidence, and the skills of command. At the same time, her own intelligence began to manifest, and she was quick to understand that she was now free to pursue her own path.  Daenerys spent her entire early life living on the sufferance of others, bouncing back and forth between benefactors (like Illyrio Mopatis) with her brother, until whatever dreams those benefactors had of supporting the siblings' claim to the Iron Throne wore off, and they were forced to move on to another patron. As a result, Daenerys never knew a true home, and constantly living under her brother's domination gave her great empathy with the downtrodden of the world: she was deeply sympathetic to those she perceived as oppressed, while at the same time, her pent-up frustration from years of being dominated by her petty would-be-king of a brother made Daenerys capable of utter ruthlessness against those she perceived as oppressing others. This experience caused Daenerys to develop a largely black-and-white worldview, and she could be idealistic to a fault: upon seeing the plight of the slaves in Slaver's Bay, Daenerys became determined to free all the slaves in the region, with little thought devoted to the practical after-effects which would result from such an action and without thinking that between some slaves and their masters could exist respect or even love. A particular example of this is when the Great Masters of Meereen crucified 163 children as she approached the city in an attempt to intimidate her. After she took the city, instead of pardoning the slave-masters, she had 163 of them crucified in retribution, including many who opposed the crucifixion of the children, unconcerned about any negative political fallout which would result.  Other examples of Daenerys's naivety and narrow-mindedness were when Tyrion asked her how she intended to take the Iron Throne, and Daenerys answered that she would simply earn the common people's favor. This demonstrated both her lack of understanding of the real power wielded by the noble houses, and that she didn't have a clear vision of the political situation in Westeros; in Slaver's Bay, she earned the favor of the commoners by abolishing slavery, but in Westeros there were no slaves to free or similarly oppressed people to help. The invasion she ended up launching against Cersei made Daenerys, in the citizens' eyes, a conqueror rather than a liberator. She caused further suffering to those who had already lost so much during the [[War of the Five Kings|previous war]] and, in the eyes of Northmen, she was the one who came to deny them the independence they had gained after so many sacrifices. While such an outcome would almost certainly have happened, the fact that Daenerys was genuinely surprised at the lack of accommodation to her rule proves even more the idealistic vision she had of Westeros.  Her keeping to consider Westeros her home, while she was just born there, and her disappointment for the Westerosi's lack of recognition, while Ser Jorah himself told her from the beginning that the smallfolk don't care who their ruler is as long their lives are free from starvation, illness, and war, showed another aspect that made her fell prey of her naivety: her stubbornness. Even before departing from Essos her advisors, directly or not, warned her that coming to Westeros wouldn't have made her a liberator. Then her reaction showed how much she refused to accept the reality: she didn't have peaceful ways to be recognized as the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms, but her determination prevented her from questioning herself and her position before it was too late to find a solution.   About her family's fame, particularly after her brother's death, Daenerys has always shown a dual and, in some cases, opportunistic if not even hypocritical consideration: Daenerys has always remarked how much different she was from her father, who she was not afraid to call ''evil'' to reassure others about the goodness of her intentions, just as both she and her supporters have always remarked that she became queen through her own strength and that they follow her by choice; however, Daenerys kept using her status as the Mad King's daughter as a right to aspire to the Iron Throne, as well as, during her first meeting with the then King in the North, Jon Snow, in the face of the latter's reluctance to bow to her, Daenerys, who a minute earlier had asked him to not judge her on the basis of her father's actions, tried to intimidate him by accusing Jon's (supposed) father, Ned Stark, of conspiring with Robert Baratheon in his attempt to kill her. And even after accepting that her father was maybe the worst ruler in history, she kept considering Jaime Lannister only a traitor. This leaves a big question about how much she cared about her father, if she truly loved him or if she considered him only a tool for reconquer the Iron Throne.  Daenerys showed herself to be quite vengeful on several occasions, mainly to individuals who had caused her significant grievances. When Mirri Maz Duur tricked her into allowing the use blood magic to "save" Drogo, Daenerys had the witch bound and burnt alive. Upon learning the role that Xaro and Doreah played in the theft of her dragons (and the deaths of her servants), she had them both locked in an empty vault. She had Randyll and Dickon Tarly burned alive for refusing to bend the knee after she defeated them in battle, which may have further soured her reputation in Westeros along with Cersei's anti-Daenerys propaganda. In the last case, however, it is worth noting that she executed them only after offering them the choice of surrender, which they declined. Tyrion also seemed to believe that her execution of the Tarlys was more the result of losing her temper, rather than any deliberate ruthlessness. Also, her refusal of listening to Tyrion in that moment could be caused also by both her anger against his military failure and by Olenna Tyrell's advice about learning to take decisions by herself.  Despite her perceived confidence and ruthlessness, Daenerys has displayed surprisingly tender emotion and at times can appear quite vulnerable, at least in private. Her fondness for children has been shown multiple times, and when Drogon incinerated the young daughter of a shepherd in Meereen, she was visibly disturbed, which led to her locking Rhaegal and Viserion in the catacombs to prevent further atrocities. When attempting to quell the opposition to her rule in Meereen, she finds herself at a loss and desperately asks Missandei for her input, not trying to hide her frazzled state. After rescuing Jon and company from a wight attack - and losing Viserion in the process - she doesn't try to hide her tears. In the same interaction, when Jon declares his loyalty to her and says that the other Northern lords will come to see her as he does, she says in a rather small voice "I hope I deserve it", showing a sense of doubt that had rarely been displayed before.  It is debatable whether Daenerys was a highly skilled battle commander. She ''did'' win some impressive victories, especially her swift conquest of Slaver's Bay and the Siege of Meereen, but each time she had a vast (and unexpected) advantage in numbers, as well as the support of her three dragons. Thus, her victories had more to do with overwhelming the enemy than brilliant tactical leadership. On the other hand, ''knowing'' that she was inexperienced in the art of warfare, Daenerys took care to surround herself with experienced and capable warriors who could advise her and help coordinate her battles. She also had a clear sense of strategy, if not specific tactics; she knew how to win battles in such a way to leave herself in the strongest position possible, and avoided engagements that would result in heavy casualties, in order to conserve and protect the troops at her disposal. Daenerys certainly knew how to put her dragons to decisive effect in battle; her use of Drogon at the Sack of Astapor and the Battle of the Goldroad ended both battles almost before they started.  After losing [[Rhaegal]] in her first battle against the Iron Fleet, Daenerys became enraged and would have incinerated the fleet then-and-there, but realized that a head-on attack would be putting her remaining dragon, [[Drogon]], in great danger. In her next encounter with the Iron Fleet, she had the insight to change her approach, managing to destroy the fleet with apparently little effort ''and'' ensure Drogon's survival. She also managed to skillfully eliminate all the scorpions perched on the battlements of King's Landing and secure the surrender of its inhabitants with what seemed like a minimal death toll.  Therefore, in her life before her descent into madness, Daenerys showed herself to be a strong and determined woman, sometimes a little too emotional, rash and idealistic, but also benevolent, decent and able to understand her mistakes and learn from them. Unfortunately, this, along with the traumas she suffered and her obsession with regaining the rule of the Seven Kingdoms, led her to be also too fragile to bear the burden of her moral defeat: despite having proved to be, both as a person and as a ruler, much better than her enemies, finding out how this was not enough to be appreciated by the other inhabitants of the Seven Kingdoms pushed her over the edge, making her the tyrant she had always sworn never to become.  ===Targaryen madness=== Initially, Daenerys did not exhibit the "[[Targaryen madness]]" that plagued many of her ancestors, including her father and, to a lesser extent, her brother Viserys. Like most Targaryens, she could be ruthless to her perceived enemies, but while Viserys was cruel and demanding to his servants and even his benefactors, Daenerys reciprocated the loyalty of those who followed her with gratitude and compassion, especially towards her inner circle of friends and her dragons. On the other hand, insanity was often a late-onset condition in the Targaryens, and it didn't always manifest in obvious ways: One could argue that certain of Daenerys's actions, such as her crucifixion of 163 slave masters in Meereen and her burning the men of [[House Tarly]] with dragonfire, were telltale signs of Targaryen madness, but even these are not as simple as they appear: In the former case, she felt she was avenging the deaths of 163 innocent slave children that the masters had crucified in order to intimidate her, thus there was a well-intentioned, if brutal, motive behind the act. In the latter case, the men of House Tarly were in open rebellion against her and had refused her offer of bending the knee, thus making the distinction different from inflicting punishment for its own sake.  In Daenerys's case, whatever traces of the Targaryen madness she had within her were also heavily exacerbated by a series of unexpected external factors. This series of intense political blows and significant personal losses, all of which were experienced in a fairly short period of time, had a noticeable effect on her mental state:  *After Jon Snow told her about his true parentage, Daenerys realized he had the better claim to the Iron Throne and she began to display increasing paranoia about her legitimacy, despite the fact that Jon had renounced his claim and vowed to support her. *Towards the end of the Battle of Ice and Fire, an already devastated Daenerys witnessed the death of her most devoted follower, closest advisor, and longtime friend Ser Jorah Mormont. *After the battle was won and matters turned once again to ousting Cersei, Daenerys feared that if word of Jon's parentage spread, others would press his claim to the throne over hers, regardless of Jon's unwillingness to take it. **She told Jon that he must never tell anybody the truth about himself, but Jon felt he owed the truth to his sisters [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. Having already faced a cold reception from Sansa regarding her unwillingness to accept Northern independence, Daenerys believed that Sansa would conspire to see Jon on the Iron Throne over herself. While Jon was certain Sansa would keep the truth secret, Daenerys warned him the truth would lead to disaster. Additionally, Jon's halting their physical intimacy upon finding out about their blood relation could also have contributed to Daenerys's mental degradation.  *When Daenerys later arrived at Dragonstone to prepare for her invasion of King's Landing, her second dragon, Rhaegal, was shot down by Euron Greyjoy and his fleet. Her beloved companion Missandei was also captured by Euron during his ambush, and subsequently executed by the Mountain on Cersei's orders, while Daenerys watched from afar during a failed parley. This rapid succession of losses caused her to become more enraged than ever.  *Her sense of paranoia increased when she discovered that Jon had told Sansa and Arya about his parentage - and despite Jon swearing Sansa and Arya to secrecy, Sansa had told Tyrion. Tyrion subsequently told Varys, and Varys later attempted to poison Daenerys out of fear that she was becoming more and more like her father. While Daenerys fulfilled her previous promise to Varys that she would burn him alive if he ever conspired against her, the end result was that most members of her inner circle were now dead. *Finally, she felt she could also no longer fully trust Tyrion due to his poor military strategy, conflict of interest regarding his desire to spare his family, actions that unintentionally led to Varys scheming to overthrow her, and slow effort to warn her about what were - in her eyes - predictable dangers to her mission.  During the [[Battle of King's Landing]], Daenerys finally snapped - burning the inhabitants alive even though the city had surrendered to her - and by all appearances seemed to have gone mad. However, this may not have been the actual "Targaryen madness" that prompted her father to attempt a similar action: It is equally possible that her actions were motivated or even triggered by the extreme anger and grief over her recent losses, most of which were caused in some way by the Lannisters. Also, it should be noted that the Targaryen Madness, historically, does not always equate to "insanity" as we might understand it. In fact, of all the Targaryens who ruled as kings, the only one who could truly be called "insane" in the contemporary sense was Aerys II; Daenerys's father heard voices in his head and lost all touch with reality. Daenerys displayed no such symptoms, and after her destructive rampage, she seemed perfectly lucid when speaking to Jon in the ruins of the Red Keep. Madness takes many forms, including true psychopathy, which seems to have emerged in Daenerys. Though her actions may be justifiable, that does not make them right, or proof of a sound mind. Her ancestor Maegor, it could be argued, was justified in taking a similarly harsh hand in dealing with the rebellious Faith Militant, but his cruelty was objectively excessive and, as his successor, Jaehaerys I, proved, not the only solution to the problem.  Daenerys's extreme actions could also have been triggered by the destruction of her dreams: While she had accepted the stories of her father's madness were true, she sincerely believed it was her destiny to become [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|Queen of the Seven Kingdoms]] by virtue of her birthright. Her many accomplishments in Essos, including her dragons' birth, her liberation of slaves, and her persuading the Dothraki to follow her across the sea, only furthered this vision of a grand destiny in her mind. As Tyrion had previously warned her, however, neither her accomplishments nor her birthright were guaranteed to secure support in Westeros, either from the common people or the noble houses. After discovering that Jon was the true heir to the Iron Throne, and that people in Westeros viewed her not as a liberator but as an invader, she realized that her dreams were truly empty. This would have been a great blow to her psyche, and unable to accept a future in which she wouldn't sit on the Iron Throne, she decided that she had to take it by force.  The sight of the [[Red Keep]] and the sound of its tolling bell triggered something in Daenerys and finally caused her to snap. She seemingly showed no mercy as thousands of innocent people died in dragonfire, and shocked her allies with the devastation she wrought. Daenerys appeared to turn into a worse tyrant than those she set out to eliminate, posing an ethical dilemma for her former lover and prime claimant to the Iron Throne, Jon Snow, whom Daenerys hoped would join her in ruling her new world. After discussing the recent turn of events and the dramatic shift in Daenerys's personality with an incarcerated Tyrion, Jon made the fateful decision to end her reign before it began; for the good of the realm and its people - the same values that the Night's Watch and his own experiences had long instilled in him - Jon tearfully plunged his dagger into Daenerys's heart. Whether she truly succumbed to the Targaryen Madness or not, in the end she became like her father, the one thing she did not want to be, and tragically suffered the same fate as him; stabbed to death by one she thought truly loyal to her.  ==Relationships== ReferencesSection *'''Khal Drogo''': the most powerful Dothraki ''khal'' of his time and Daenerys's first husband, to whom she was betrothed by Viserys and Illyrio Mopatis in order to secure Drogo's Dothraki army in their campaign to retake the Iron Throne from Robert Baratheon. At first, Daenerys was intimidated by Drogo, but came to love him after learning he was a smart leader and kind man. Drogo himself grew to love and respect Daenerys as his ''khaleesi'', which led to them conceiving a child, Rhaego. However, after sacking a village, Drogo was infected in a fight with a rebellious blood-rider and the wound festered, and he was ultimately rendered catatonic by the blood magic by Mirri Maz Duur, which also claimed Rhaego's life. Daenerys smothered Drogo out of pity and cremated him on a funeral pyre. *'''Daario Naharis''': a lieutenant in the Second Sons sellsword company who became smitten with Daenerys and killed his superiors when they advocated assassinating Daenerys for the Masters of Yunkai. Daenerys eventually developed a sexual relationship with Daario which grew into genuine love, on his part. She ultimately ended their relationship on Tyrion Lannister's advice so she could pursue political alliances through marriage just before leaving for Westeros, and they parted ways on good terms. *'''Ser Jorah Mormont''': an exiled knight from Westeros who has long loved Daenerys but until recently found his feelings for her largely unrequited, especially after she learned he was initially spying on her, for which she banished him. However, upon seeing the lengths he went to rescue her, even after contracting greyscale, she orders him to find a cure for himself so that he can be by her side in the event that she takes back the Seven Kingdoms. After being successfully cured by [[Samwell Tarly]] in the [[Citadel]], Jorah returns to Daenerys's service. Although they are both aware of Jorah's feelings for her, he seems content to remain her servitor and not her lover. *'''Jon Snow''': the alleged bastard son of Ned Stark, but in reality, the hidden son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, making him Daenerys's nephew by blood. They later fall in love and become lovers. Neither Daenerys nor Jon are aware of their blood relationship or Jon's true origins at first. Having been summoned from Winterfell to bend the knee to Daenerys, Jon refuses on the grounds that he doesn't know her, his people won't accept a southern ruler, and it's more important to ally against the [[Night King]] and the army of the dead than to remove Cersei from the Iron Throne. Though Jon and Daenerys are initially wary and distrustful of one another, they begin to warm to each other. Upon realizing that the threat of the Night King may be real after all, Daenerys becomes more open to Jon; over the course of their time together, feelings begin to develop between them. *After [[Viserion]] is killed by the [[Night King]] in a skirmish beyond the Wall,, Daenerys vows to destroy the Night King alongside Jon, who, upon seeing Daenerys's strength of character and devotion, bends the knee and pledges himself to her as his Queen. Jon and Daenerys give in to their feelings and consummate their relationship while on the ship sailing North, and they fall in love.[https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/22/game-of-thrones-emilia-clarke-jon-dany-interview/][https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/14/game-of-thrones-kit-harington-reveals-jon-snow-parentage/] Meanwhile, [[Bran Stark|Bran]] reveals to [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]] that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, after which Samwell tells Bran that he discovered Rhaegar had his marriage to Elia Martell annulled before marrying Lyanna. Bran goes into the past and learns from a vision that Jon is the true-born son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and thus the true heir to the Iron Throne ahead of Daenerys. *This revelation affects Jon and Daenerys's newfound alliance and personal relationship in crucial ways and has far-reaching implications for the realm. At this point, a coin toss seems to separate them from being brought closer together and continuing their romantic relationship, forging a powerful alliance possibly by marriage* - as Targaryens have done in the past - or being driven apart due to their cultural and psychological differences - owing to their very different upbringings and personal experiences. :: *Although the prospect of marriage between Daenerys and Jon is never discussed by them, the "proposal of a proposal" is raised by [[Davos Seaworth]] when he speaks with Tyrion and Varys at Winterfell. Focusing on the issue of loyalty and the need to forge alliances, Davos raises the possibility of a marriage-alliance between Jon and Daenerys being beneficial for the security of the realm. He refers to their potential union as that of a "just queen and an honorable man." This is prior to either of them discovering Jon's identity. After finding out Jon's true identity, Tyrion and Varys discuss a potential marriage between Jon and Daenerys twice, once on the boat to Dragonstone and once at Dragonstone; neither of them discusses it with Daenerys or Jon. *Prior to them both finding out about their kinship, Daenerys confides with Sansa that she loves Jon, and that she deferred her life long quest for the [[Iron Throne]] - to help fight the [[Night King]] and the Army of the Dead which was threatening humanity - because of this love. *At Winterfell, whilst celebrating the victory of the living over the dead, Daenerys visits Jon in his chamber, whereupon he consoles her about Ser [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]]'s death, saying if he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting her. Daenerys reveals the true depth of her affections for Jon when she says that Jorah loved her, but she could not love him the same way, the way she loves Jon. Jon begins to kiss her and the couple engages, beginning to remove each other's clothes but Jon hesitates and pulls back. At this point, Daenerys says she wishes he'd never told her; that she would be much happier not knowing. Though Jon renounces his claim in favor of her own, Daenerys's observation of the love the wildlings have for Jon makes her doubt Westeros will ever have that kind of love for her. **It is at that point that Daenerys first expresses her feelings towards Jon as a threat to her claim to the throne. She worries what will happen if people were to find out and demand that he presses his claim. While Jon insists he'll refuse and that she's his queen, she points out that it doesn't matter if he wants the [[Iron Throne]] - he didn't want to be [[King in the North]], but it was still expected of him. Her solution is for Jon to say ''nothing'' to ''anyone'' about his parentage, and to ''swear [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]] and [[Bran Stark|Bran]] to secrecy''. She fears the truth will take on a life of its own and he won't be able to control it or what it does to people, which turns out to be true. Daenerys wishes that things could go back to the way they were, before they both knew of his true parentage; she fears what Sansa will do if she finds out. **Jon's divided loyalties become apparent at this point: he feels Sansa and Arya - two of the people he grew up with and loves as his siblings - deserve to know the truth about himself. When Daenerys asks, "Even if the truth destroys us?" Jon is certain this won't happen and his sisters will keep it secret while Daenerys seems certain it will lead to disaster. She tells him she has never begged for anything before, and proceeds to beg him not to tell them the truth. When Jon is certain he, Daenerys, and his siblings can all live together with the truth, Daenerys believes that is only possible if Jon remains silent.  Dialogue a-b|Jon|You are my Queen, nothing can change that; and they are my family: we '''can''' live together.|Daenerys|We can. '''I've just told you how'''.|[[The Last of the Starks]]  *At Dragonstone, Daenerys raises her concern about the love the people of Westeros have for him, whereas she has only their fear. In an effort to compensate, Jon tells Daenerys that ''he'' loves her and that she will always be his queen. She asks him if that is ''all'' she is to him - his queen, implying that she wants more from him than a lord to swear fealty to her; she wants him as her lover. (As noted above, she had previously confided to Sansa the importance of her love for him, and that she loves Jon in the same way Jorah loved her). Daenerys tries to re-engage their relationship but, though he gives in at first, Jon again disengages from their physical intimacy; their relationship is visibly strained due to his unease surrounding their close blood relation*. Daenerys resigns herself to letting the fear she has inspired in Westeros be her ruling principle. :: *For Daenerys (a Targaryen born and bred), incest between lovers is not an issue. Whilst the proposal of marriage is not brought up by either character, a marital union between them could have resulted in a beneficial alliance between her powerful and feared army and his esteemed status as the King in the North. It is uncertain if the prospect occurs to Daenerys, although it likely crosses her mind. The line "let it be fear" indicates that she accepts the prospect of the Westerosi not loving her. This inability of Jon's - to return to his sexual relationship with Daenerys - is one of many triggers that add to Daenerys's mental decline. *Following the destruction of King's Landing, Jon confronts Daenerys about the genocide she perpetrated. They have fundamental disagreements about the way to go about building the new world: Daenerys believes mercy is now a weakness to be reserved for a new world whereas Jon pleads with Daenerys that forgiveness and mercy are what is required now. Daenerys is unwavering. They disagree on what is good: Daenerys is certain that her way is the only way to bring about a good world and that she ''knows'' what is good, telling Jon that he does as well; others don't get to choose. Jon sees her authoritarianism as immovable. Full of hope, she tells a distressed Jon she wants him with her to rule this new world she plans to create. They share a kiss before he reluctantly plunges a dagger into her heart. Stunned, Daenerys dies in a devastated Jon's arms, thus bringing their relationship to its tragic conclusion.  ==Titles== ReferencesSection Daenerys is the second member of the Targaryen dynasty to bear her name. The first [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]] was the sister of King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], who lived a century before Daenerys Stormborn. The earlier Daenerys wed into House Martell as part of the marriage-alliance, earning her the moniker "Daenerys of Sunspear", which at last united [[Dorne]] with the rest of the realm. Since Daenerys of Sunspear did not rule as a queen regnant, Daenerys Stormborn is not called "Daenerys II." When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty, she is styled officially as "Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name" (Xaro is the first to address her by that title). Daenerys is quite fond of her "Stormborn" sobriquet, however, and frequently substitutes it for "First of Her Name."  According to Missandei, Daenerys's full title is "Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the ''Mother of Dragons'', the ''Khaleesi'' of the Great Grass Sea, the ''Unburnt'', the ''Breaker of Chains''." She formerly used the full title of "Queen of the Andals, ''the Rhoynar'', and the First Men" alongside her past title of ''Queen of Meereen''. *While she is technically only a claimant to the Iron Throne, she has been acknowledged as queen by Dorne, House Tyrell (now extinct), [[Jon Snow]], and a faction of the divided House Greyjoy. *She ruled Meereen in her own right, the right of conquest. Technically, she ruled the entirety of Slaver's Bay, but her main base of operations in Essos was Meereen. She gave up her claim to Meereen in order to pursue her birthright, ruling the Seven Kingdoms; however, she retains authority over Meereen through Daario and the Second Sons, at least until the people are ready to choose their new leaders. *Daenerys continues to claim the title of ''khaleesi'' as a matter of personal pride, even though she is violating Dothraki tradition by acting in her own interests and not recusing herself to Vaes Dothrak; the territorial designation "of the Great Grass Sea" might be her own invention or a borrowed address of respect from one of the Free Cities. Although she never claimed to be the sole ''khaleesi'', following her killing the ''khals'' and uniting nearly all the Dothraki under her leadership, she has few challengers to the title. *The remainder of her titles refer to her personal actions:  She took the title Breaker of Chains after the [[Sack of Astapor]]. She calls herself "the Unburnt" due to her miraculous survival of Drogo's funeral pyre, and the conflagrations at the [[House of the Undying]] and the [[Temple of the dosh khaleen|temple of the ''dosh khaleen'']]. It was that same pyre that, of course, gave Daenerys her most impressive title, "Mother of Dragons."  Daenerys is increasingly referred to as the "Dragon Queen" as her exploits become more famous and the dragons grow, but this is a matter of common parlance and not a title she uses herself."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  :''The title "Queen Across the Sea" has been used to describe Daenerys in promotional materials, particularly for Season 2, where she was billed as the fifth "king" in the War of the Five Kings (Balon Greyjoy had not yet been introduced). The title has never been used in-universe.'' :''Daenerys is a "[[Wikipedia:Queen regnant|Queen Regnant]]" because she inherited the throne in her own right from her father. She is the second Queen Regnant (ruling queen) in the history of the Targaryen dynasty, after [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. Compare Daenerys's inheritance to the manner in which the real-life [[Wikipedia:Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I of England]] was a "Queen Regnant" because she inherited the throne from her father. In contrast, [[Margaery Tyrell]] was a "Queen Consort" and was called "Queen" only because she was married to the ruling king. Similarly, [[Catelyn Stark]] became "Lady Consort" of Winterfell (usually shortened to "Lady of Winterfell") because she married the then-current [[Lord of Winterfell]].''  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 1 appearances|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes GoT/Season 2 appearances|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes GoT/Season 3 appearances|yes|no|yes|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes GoT/Season 4 appearances|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes||yes GoT/Season 5 appearances|yes|yes||yes|yes|9 = yes|7 = yes|8 = yes|10 = yes GoT/Season 6 appearances|yes||yes|yes|yes|yes||yes|yes|yes GoT/Season 7 appearances|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes GoT/Season 8 appearances|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes|yes  ==Family tree== House Targaryen family tree  ==Quotes== ;Spoken by Daenerys Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Daenerys Targaryen|Tell them all to stop.|Jorah Mormont|You want the entire horde to stop?

WPS|Elizabeth Olsen auditioned for the role, but her audition went poorly.[https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2019/05/20/elizabeth-olsen-recalls-her-terrible-audition-for-role-of-daenerys-in-game-of-thrones/23730846/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANxrdtQFB9ogl2-usaGJgoz2bKWFGQGCXhFoPgJw2tXk8i74QqVGXglz4RxSoN8Coqa3DMoKQbSu5UMi9EJI5d2aFjprocMR0k4qEMrgc4iDPqD_yFnbD61ZGAo7EZu-0-yPlpLmtiplNIrpiJqOG0_FWavKioTgL5_oU_7l0I6Q Elizabeth Olsen recalls her ‚Äòterrible‚Äô audition for role of Daenerys in ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô]  ===Costuming=== Main|Costumes/Major characters#Daenerys Targaryen Costume Designer [[Michele Clapton]] explained the costuming shifts that Daenerys goes through in Seasons 1 to 3. In Season 1, it is obviously a major shift when Daenerys starts to wear Dothraki clothing, showing that she is willing to immerse herself in their culture in a way Viserys never will, and earns reciprocal respect from them as a result. However, as Season 1 progresses, Daenerys later switches to a different outfit - still in Dothraki fashion, but made of tanned crocodile hide. The Dothraki also wear animal skins but use horse-leather. Daenerys put her own Targaryen-themed twist on this by still using leather made from an animal, but from a reptile to evoke her ties to the ancient dragons. In Season 2, Daenerys switches to a Qartheen gown that Xaro provides her, yet she switches into different variants in a subtle progression throughout the season. Initially, Daenerys was awed by Xaro's generosity and Qarth's elegance, but almost at the risk of losing herself: as she increasingly starts to doubt Xaro and become dissatisfied with Qarth in general (as it becomes more apparent that none of them will give her the army she needs), she starts incorporating more and more "Dothraki-style" features back into her outfit. Instead of the completely Qarth-style gown she wore in "Garden of Bones", she starts adding more metal armored pieces or leather, similar to her earlier Dothraki costume."[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]]"  In Season 3, by the time that Daenerys's ship arrives in Slaver's Bay she has shifted into a new outfit which she retains for most of the rest of the season (alternating with others such as her white gown). In the Season 3 Blu-ray, Clapton explained why Daenerys wears a bright blue dress instead of, say, the traditional Targaryen colors of red and black (which Viserys wore): blue was the color of royalty in ''Khal'' Drogo's ''khalasar''. It was the color of the expensive dye that they adorned themselves with, more so on special occasions such as Drogo's wedding. This is comparable to how purple was traditionally the color of imperial or royal authority for centuries in Europe because purple was the most expensive color dye (it could only be made from a rare sea snail). Thus, while in Season 3 Daenerys no longer wears a Dothraki-style "cut" to her outfit, she switched to blue colors as a symbol of her authority as a ''khaleesi'' and in memory of Drogo.Season 3 Blu-Ray special features  Daenerys begins to wear more white as [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Seasons 4]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|5]] progress. Clapton claims the white signifies her mental removal from some of the scenes that she has to be in, such as the fighting pit. It was chaotic and bloody, and she was supposed to be purity in the middle of it all. Therefore was visually removing herself from the things that she disagreed with. Overall, it was how she saw herself. She also plays up her connection to the dragons, with some of her dresses featuring quilting to give the impression of scales, and, since she can now have jewelry made, necklaces and rings in the shape of dragons. Clapton also noted that no matter what color she is wearing, Daenerys always wears Dothraki riding breeches underneath, as experience has taught her that she needs to be prepared for a quick getaway.[http://fashionista.com/2015/06/game-of-thrones-season-5-costume-designer-interview Fashionista interview with Michele Clapton]  Daenerys wears Dothraki clothing again for much of [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]], but after returning to and securing Meereen, she retains her previous style but wears black instead of white. Black and red are the colors of House Targaryen. Daenerys has rarely worn her House colors since her journey began, so her wearing black now is the ultimate expression of her acceptance of her identity as a Targaryen conqueror and the rightful queen of Westeros.  In [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]], Daenerys starts off by wearing all black, strong-shouldered gowns. This new style is used to establish her presence and announce her power in Westeros. Clapton states the silhouette of strong shoulders also mirrors that of her brother Viserys.[https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/4/19/18484819/game-of-thrones-daenerys-targaryen-costumes-michele-clapton] However, it simultaneously represents a dragon with spread wings. Upon her arrival at Dragonstone, her outfit is an altered version of her Season 6 finale dress, however this time there is a collar set over it, and overall includes more elaborate and symbolic design, such as the scaling and hint of red. Throughout the season she also wears a dragon chain across her torso which replaces a crown since she is not a queen yet. At one point, she also has a red sash covered in scales and sometimes has fur piping that is indicative of Westeros' colder climate. When saving Jon Snow, Daenerys wears an outfit completely different from her previous ones; a white, striped fur coat to symbolize her selfless act of rescue, rather than an act of acquiring more power.   Daenerys arrives in Winterfell at the beginning of [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|Season 8]] wearing a very similar gown to that where she rescued Jon, however this time it has a red base instead of grey, which ultimately mixes Targaryen and Northern styles, and a split in the skirt, which suits for riding a horse. Also, at one point she has one-sided shoulder fur, which was mainly added because of Daenerys wanting the Northerner's acceptance but was also incorporated as Daenerys was trying to match Jon's silhouette.  However, since it is only draped on one shoulder, she is only'' partly'' matching his silhouette, therefore, it is possible that the costumes are hinting Daenerys and Jon have a visual harmony that only works from ''one'' angle. Also, the juxtaposition between Jon's dark costume and Daenerys' light costume alludes to both their differences. Throughout the season, her costumes vary by how she feels. For example, whenever she feels alienated or threatened, she reasserts her authority by wearing more of her House colors or the strong-shoulders. Eventually, during the Battle of King's Landing, she wears a bluish, scale-embossed dress with a visible dragon chain, which was (arguably) purposefully hidden behind her hair to hide her conqueror side, accompanied by a red sash, which was also fastened beneath her shoulder instead of above her shoulder, therefore appearing more hidden. So when she attacks the city, she appears a formidable conqueror, however, the dress is unique and symbolizes that she had different intentions.   ===Fireproof?=== In the books, Daenerys does not appear to be "fireproof." [[George R.R. Martin|Martin]] has stated that her ability to survive Drogo's funeral pyre was a special circumstance, a [[Blood magic|blood magic]] ritual involving "fire and blood" - only life can pay for a life, so burning [[Mirri Maz Duur]] in the funeral pyre was enough to awaken the life in the dormant dragon eggs. Under ''normal'' circumstances, Daenerys is no more immune to fire than any other human. Her brother Viserys once claimed in the novels that Targaryens were a race above other men, immune to both fire and illness - this was blatantly wrong, given that ''multiple'' Targaryens in the past are well-known for having burned to death, and many have succumbed to common illnesses over the years (including [[greyscale]]). Viserys's comment just highlights how little he knew about Targaryen history (or anything else). It does appear that Targaryens seem to have a slightly higher heat tolerance than average, though: at Illyrio's mansion Daenerys takes a bath in near-scalding hot water, despite the protests of her maidservant, but in the novels, she thinks to herself how pleasant the heat feels (this also happened in the first episode of the TV series). Still, this is nothing outside the normal human range - i.e. any more than centuries of history have shaped the Dornish to be more comfortable in the dry desert heat, or shaped the wildlings to be more accustomed to a cold climate. In fact, when Daenerys rides Drogon out of the Great Pit of Meereen, she is stated to have burns and blisters on her hands from the flames.  The series, however, appears to suggest that Daenerys might, in fact, have some actual fireproofing ability. In addition to the bath scene in "[[Winter Is Coming]]", Daenerys doesn't notice the heat from the brazier in "[[A Golden Crown]]", and notably, her hands are unburnt, while [[Irri]]'s are blistered immediately after picking up the egg. It could be argued that she displayed this ability again in "[[Valar Morghulis]]", when she has her dragons burn down the House of the Undying, although it's possible that the dragons managed to just aim the fire ''past'' Daenerys at Pyat Pree (notice her clothes are intact after this incident). Most glaring, however, is Daenerys's stunt at the Temple of the ''dosh khaleen'', from which she emerges again unburnt. In the "Inside the Episode" feature for "[[Book of the Stranger]]", Weiss and Benioff imply that Daenerys does indeed have this ability in some fashion, although she only decided to exploit it after Jorah and Daario showed up.  It should be pointed out that even if Daenerys is fireproof in the series, there is no indication that all Targaryens are, as most fire-related deaths the House has suffered are mentioned as being similar to those in the books. This adds another layer to Viserys's death: Daenerys was realizing that heat and fire didn't affect her like they did most people, and (correctly) suspected that Viserys lacked this resistance.  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daenerys was born on the Targaryen island refuge of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] eight months after her father's death. Her mother died giving birth to her, and a great storm raged at the moment of her birth, destroying what was left of the Targaryen fleet anchored at Dragonstone, giving rise to the nickname "Stormborn." The infant Daenerys and her brother Viserys were spirited into exile across the Narrow Sea by Ser Willem Darry, a loyal retainer of their family, before the castle garrison could hand them over to [[Robert Baratheon]].  In the books, Daenerys is the great-granddaughter of Aegon V, not his granddaughter. The showrunners truncated the Targaryen family line in order to simplify her relationship to [[Aemon|Aemon Targaryen]]. They accomplished this by eliminating the reign of Jaehaerys II and making [[Aerys II Targaryen]] the son of [[Aegon V Targaryen]] instead of his grandson.  The books go into a little more detail about Daenerys's early life in the Free Cities. Initially, Daenerys lived with Ser Willem and Viserys in [[Braavos]], in a house with a big red door. Ser Willem was old and bedridden and yelled at the servants, but was very kind to Daenerys. After several years, Ser Willem died and the servants drove the Targaryen children from the house, taking what money they had. Daenerys was old enough to remember living in this house and has recurrent dreams about her last sight of the big red door, which came to symbolize the childhood she never had. The house in Braavos was the closest thing to a home Daenerys ever had, but even she never considered herself to be truly home here. Afterward, the Targaryen children bounced around between different patrons, each enjoying having the Targaryen exiles as guests but abandoning them when the novelty wore off. Some briefly entertained the idea of helping them retake the Iron Throne, but as the years passed and Robert Baratheon's rule appeared more and more secure, the number of patrons dwindled and their lives grew meaner. Daenerys grew up living on the sufferance of others, frequently turned out on the street with little warning when their patrons lost interest in them. Viserys was reduced to pathetically begging for support throughout the Free Cities as they moved from patron to patron. In the process, they traveled from Braavos to Myr, then to Tyrosh, then to Qohor, then to Volantis, then to Lys, and ultimately to Pentos (each of the Free Cities except Norvos and Lorath). They never lived in one place for more than a few months, and their stay in Pentos with Illyrio was actually the longest time they had lived in one place since Braavos (for six months in the books, but stated to be over a year in the TV series).  Daenerys does not appear to have a particular religious affiliation in the books. She grew up in the Free Cities, which have a more diverse religious composition than Westeros, so she has been exposed to several different religions but finds them to be confusing. Her final chapter in the third novel (''A Storm of Swords'' - Daenerys VI) begins with an inner narration from her POV in which she ponders aspects of different religions. The Targaryens converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]] when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros three hundred years ago, and the ancient Valyrian religion is long extinct. Daenerys's brother Viserys apparently made some effort to explain the basic principles of the Faith of the Seven to her, considering that he hoped they would one day rule again over the Seven Kingdoms, where it is the dominant religion - but Daenerys thinks that the concept of a single god who is split into seven facets is confusing. She is also aware of the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]] religion, given that it is the most popular religion in the Free Cities, but she thinks that its belief in a constant violent struggle between R'hllor and the Great Other to be too violent. Daenerys, therefore, has no particularly strong religious affiliations but is fairly open-minded to the religions of new peoples she meets in Essos. While not outright "converting" to the [[Great Stallion]] religion of the Dothraki, after marrying Drogo out of love for her husband's god she finds herself praying to the great horse in the sky at times, even after Drogo's death. Still, Daenerys isn't particularly sure what her personal beliefs are. The TV series doesn't spend much time on this question either: it is only in Season 7 that Daenerys bluntly says that she has faith only in herself and not in any god. ''The World of Ice & Fire'' suggests that this was a common attitude amongst the [[Dragonlords]] of Old Valyria.  Daenerys is thirteen years old when the events of the novels begin. Initially, she is somewhat quiet and reticent, and fearful of her brother's infamous rages, but also curious about life in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and eager to learn more of life there. She has a kind and generous spirit. This spirit slowly begins to harden after her brother's death and after surviving her first assassination attempt.  Unbeknownst to Daenerys, her nephew [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia, is alive, as revealed in ''A Dance with Dragons''. They were supposed to meet in Volantis, but Daenerys has decided to remain in Meereen, and Aegon cannot reach her due to the [[Second Siege of Meereen|siege]]. Aegon is initially certain that Daenerys will marry him and give him her armies and dragons for the purpose of conquering Westeros; in contrast to Jon's show character, Aegon does not see anything wrong about marrying his aunt. Tyrion pours cold water on the overconfident youth's hopes, pointing out that his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities. Tyrion comments that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the [[Golden Company]]), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters, and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals. Aegon follows Tyrion's advice; so far, Daenerys has not heard of him. It has yet to be seen how she will react when she finds out she has a living family relative, whose claim to the Iron Throne is stronger than hers.  Daenerys fits the prophecies about "[[The Prince That Was Promised|the prince that was promised]]" and about [[Azor Ahai]] (which may refer to the same person) as well: *According to Melisandre, "''When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone''." Daenerys was born on Dragonstone, which is a volcanic island - a place of "smoke and salt"; she has hatched fossilized dragon eggs into live dragons, in a miraculous ritual under the [[Red Comet|red comet]] at the pyre of her late husband Drogo. **Apparently, Melisandre is unaware of the above, since she keeps stating Stannis is Azor Ahai (although Stannis was born on Storm's End and has not woken any stone dragons). *Maester Aemon explains that the word "prince" in High Valyrian is gender-neutral. He claims that Daenerys is the prince that was promised; the dragons prove that.  ==See also== *AWOIAF *WP  ==References== Reflist|2  ===Notes=== Notelist   House Targaryen Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men   DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Daenerys [[Category:Crownlanders]] [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Dragon dreamers|Daenerys Targaryen]] [[Category:Dragonriders]] [[Category:Exiles]] [[Category:Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men]] [[Category:Members of House Targaryen|Daenerys Targaryen]] [[Category:Princes of Dragonstone|Daenerys Targaryen]] [[Category:Princesses]] [[Category:Queens]]   [[de:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[es:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[fr:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[he:◊ì◊ê◊ô◊†◊®◊ô◊ñ ◊ò◊ê◊®◊í◊ê◊®◊ô◊ô◊ü]] [[it:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[lt:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[nl:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[pl:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[pt-br:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[ro:Daenerys Targaryen (serial)]] [[ru:–î–µ–π–Ω–µ—Ä–∏—Å –¢–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä–∏–µ–Ω]] [[sv:Daenerys Targaryen]] [[uk:–î–µ–π–µ–Ω–µ—Ä—ñ—Å –¢–∞—Ä–≥–∞—Ä—ñ—î–Ω]] [[zh:‰∏πÂ¶ÆËéâ‰∏ù¬∑Âù¶Ê†ºÂà©ÂÆâ]]
