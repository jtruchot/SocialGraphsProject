Martyn is captured at the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. It is not him but his cousin Tion Frey (son of [[Genna Lannister]], [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s sister, and Emmon Frey) who is killed alongside Willem by Rickard Karstark. After Willem and Tion's death, Robb orders to triple the guard on Martyn for his protection, and later exchanges him for a northern prisoner ([[Robett Glover]]).  Martyn is not mentioned in the books afterwards.  ==See also== *AWOIAF *AWOIAF|Tion Frey  ==References== Reflist   House Lannister   DEFAULTSORT:Lannister, Martyn [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Members of House Lannister|Martyn Lannister]] [[Category:Squires]] [[Category:Westermen]]   [[de:Martyn Lennister]] [[fr:Martyn Lannister]] [[pl:Martyn Lannister]] [[ru:Мартин Ланнистер]]
