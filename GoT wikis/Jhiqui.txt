Jhiqui, along with Irri and Doreah, helps her to walk to a tent. While Jhiqui and the other two tend to Daenerys in the tent, Daenerys asks them if they have seen [[dragon]]s. Irri states that dragons are gone. Jhiqui agrees and insists that there are no dragons becouse brave men killed them and it is known. Jhiqui also sides with Irri in saying that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims. Daenerys is intrigued by Doreah's "dragon egg" story and asks Jhiqui and Irri to leave her alone with Doreah."[[The Kingsroad]]"  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|2=yes  ==Behind the scenes== Jhiqui has only appeared in a single episode. It is not clear if she remained loyal to Daenerys following the death of Drogo, though if she did it is unlikely she survived long as Daenerys's entire remaining ''khalasar'' is shown on camera in "[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]" and she is not present. Nevertheless, a Dothraki handmaiden is shown in "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]", though it is unknown if she is meant to represent Jhiqui.  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jhiqui is a member of a ''[[khalasar]]'' defeated in battle by Drogo's. She was enslaved and later given to Daenerys to teach her the [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki language]].  In the fifth novel, Jhiqui and Irri both develop a crush on [[Rakharo]], who has grown more tall and muscular. Both argue whom he would prefer.  Following Daenerys's departure from Meereen, Jhiqui and Irri accompany the Dothraki search parties, dispatched across the [[Skahazadhan]] to locate their queen.  In the books, Jhiqui is frequently seen with Irri, both in service to Daenerys. In the TV series, however, she appears only briefly in one scene. Thus, it is unclear of the TV version of Jhiqui remains in Daenerys's khalassar or was among those who abandoned her after Drogo's death. The TV series condensed most of her role with that of Irri.  ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist|2   House Targaryen   [[Category:Dothraki]] [[Category:Handmaidens]] [[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]] [[Category:Servants and retainers of House Targaryen]]   [[de:Jhiqui]] [[es:Jhiqui]] [[ru:Чхику]] [[zh:姬琪]]
