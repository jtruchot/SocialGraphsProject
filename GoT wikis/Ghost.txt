Screenshot (18).png|Ghost prepares to defend Jon's body alongside Davos and some of the Black Brothers against Alliser Thorne.   ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ghost is the quietest and stealthiest of the six direwolf pups. While the other wolves are darker-colored, Ghost is an albino and silent. Jon Snow's younger brother Bran Stark notices that Ghost has already opened his eyes while the other pups' eyes remain closed. Ghost's like-but-unlike nature appeals to Jon as a kindred spirit and he shares Jon's thoughtful, observant, and quiet nature. Also shared is that Jon and Ghost are both part of their respective families, but a bit apart from their siblings at the same time as Jon is an illegitimate child while Ghost is a silent, albino wolf.Shaw, Robert (2003). "Interview With a Dragon". Fountainhead Quarterly. Ghost's appearance is said to resemble that of the faces found on [[heart tree]]s in the [[North]].  Jon finds Ghost separated from his siblings. Ghost also matured faster than the others: he was the first to open his eyes and walk on his own, and was attempting to find shelter away from their mother's corpse. Like in the TV series, Jon also convinces his father to spare the pups for his trueborn siblings and later finds the sixth pup shortly afterward. However, unlike in the TV series, Theon suggests they leave the pup to die, which Jon emphatically refuses and Jon himself claims Ghost as his own.  In the books, it is emphasized that Ghost is unnaturally silent: Jon tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that he named him "Ghost" partially because of his albino coloring, but also because of how little noise he makes. In the books, Ghost is completely mute, utterly silent making no sound of any kind. This wasn't found to translate well to the screen, so Ghost makes noises like growling at Rast in his bunk or whining at Gilly holding rabbits.  Ghost accompanies Jon when he goes to Castle Black with his uncle Benjen Stark and helps Jon defend Sam from being harmed in training. When Jon joins Qhorin's scouting group, Ghost comes along. When Jon is forced to kill Qhorin as part of Qhorin's plan for Jon to infiltrate [[Mance Rayder]]'s host, Ghost helps Jon defeat Qhorin. Before going with the wildlings to scale the Wall, Jon orders Ghost to leave and attempt to return to Castle Black. Ghost departs into the forest, and Jon hopes he understood his command. Many weeks later, several days after the Battle of Castle Black is over, Ghost returns to the Wall, where Jon and Ghost are overjoyed to be reunited.  In the TV series, Ghost initially shadows Qhorin's scouting group, but he does not appear again after Jon is captured. Apparently, on his own initiative, Ghost made his way back to the Fist of the First Men, the Watch's main base camp, but it had come under attack by the White Walkers. Ghost is later seen with the survivors when he helps Jeor Mormont kill a wight that was attacking Sam. Ghost apparently then tried to return to Castle Black alongside them, but when they reach Craster's Keep, Ghost senses the coming danger, and retreats back into the Haunted Forest. In the TV show, the mutineers at Craster's Keep capture him, but when Jon leads a scouting force back to Craster's Keep to finish off the traitors, Ghost is reunited with Jon and brought back to Castle Black. Afterward, he is let loose during the wildling attack on the fortress to aid the Watch's defense, and is seen to be by Jon's side at Castle Black in Season 5 - putting him back in sync with his book location.  In the books, Melisandre warns Jon of "''daggers in the dark''" and advises him to keep Ghost near him all the time. However, Jon does not listen to Melisandre, since one of her visions about "a girl in grey on a dying horse" (whom Melisandre believed to be [[Arya Stark|Arya]], but turned to be [[Alys Karstark]]) proves to be wrong; this turns to be a fatal mistake for Jon.  In his last breath, Jon whispers "Ghost" - similar to [[Robb Stark|Robb]], whose last words were "[[Grey Wind]]". It is unknown if there is a connection between these instances. There is a fan speculation that Robb and Jon, in their last breath, managed to [[warg]] into their respective direwolves. It did not do any good for Robb, since Grey Wind was killed shortly after him; it is not the case with Jon, whose direwolf was not around when he was stabbed - he might have survived.  ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist|2   StarkDirewolves   [[Category:Direwolves]] [[Category:Living individuals]]   [[de:Geist (Schattenwolf)]] [[fr:Fantôme]] [[it:Spettro]] [[pl:Duch]] [[pt-br:Fantasma (lobo gigante)]] [[ru:Призрак]] [[zh:白灵]]
