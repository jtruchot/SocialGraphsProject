Stub A '''handmaiden''', '''handmaid''', or '''lady-in-waiting''' is a woman in the service of a noblewoman of higher status. Women of vassal Houses sometimes also serve as handmaidens and companions to noble ladies in the household of their overlords or at the royal court.  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the tasks of handmaidens or "lady attendants" vary depending on their origin. [[Noble house|Highborn]] women aid and accompany higher-status ladies and even share their beds but do not perform tasks such as preparing baths or emptying chamber pots, which are reserved for [[smallfolk|lowborn]] women.  ==See also== *AWOIAF *WP *WP|Lady-in-waiting  ==References== Reflist   [[Category:Handmaidens| ]] [[Category:Occupations]]
