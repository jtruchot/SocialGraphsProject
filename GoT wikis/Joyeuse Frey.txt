He tells her that Lord Walder is about to celebrate his 90th [[nameday]] and has taken another wife in celebration of the event. [[Tyrion Lannister]] finds this notion amusing, at least until the [[Knight of House Frey|Frey knight]] agrees to help Catelyn take Tyrion prisoner for the attempted murder of her son [[Bran Stark|Bran]]."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"  [[File:Walder and Joyeuse 1x09.png|thumb|Lord Walder and his new wife.]] Arriving at the [[Twins]], Catelyn greets Lord Walder Frey and his young, 15-year-old wife, Lady Joyeuse, whom Lord Walder gropes even as he speaks. Walder dismisses his family, including Joyeuse, while he and Catelyn haggle on what price the [[House Stark|Starks]] will pay to be allowed to cross the river."[[Baelor]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===  Lady Joyeuse is present at the main hall of the [[Twins]] when [[Robb Stark]] presents himself to pay his respects to Lord Walder and beg his forgiveness for the breaking of their [[marriage]] pact. She remains with her husband during the wedding ceremony of [[Edmure Tully]] and [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]] and sits beside him during the feast, but doesn't take part in the [[bedding]].  [[File:Catelyn_kills_Joyeuse.jpeg|thumb|Lady Frey is killed by Catelyn Stark.]] When the [[Red Wedding|massacre]] of the Stark household and bannermen begins, Joyeuse, visibly scared, hides under a table while the carnage takes place. Injured, [[Catelyn Stark]] takes her hostage and threatens to kill her if Robb is not allowed to leave the Twins untouched. However, Lord Walder refuses, boasting he can get a new wife. After Robb is murdered by [[Roose Bolton]], Catelyn slits Joyeuse's throat out of frustration."[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 1 appearances|9=yes GoT/Season 3 appearances|9=yes GoT/Season 6 appearances||||||note * Bran's vision  ==Family tree== House Frey family tree  ==Gallery==  Joyeuse Erenford.jpg|Joyeuse at the Twins in "[[Baelor]]".

House Erenford is a minor vassal house of the [[Riverlands]], sworn to [[House Frey]]. In the books, Catelyn does not kill her during the Red Wedding, but Aegon (aka Jinglebell), Lord Frey's mentally disabled grandson (not included in the TV series). Lady Joyeuse is later mentioned to be pregnant.  ==See also== *AWOIAF|Joyeuse Erenford *AWOIAF|Aegon Frey (son of Stevron)|Aegon Frey  ==References== Reflist|2   House Frey   DEFAULTSORT:Frey, Joyeuse [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:House Erenford|Joyeuse Frey]] [[Category:Ladies]] [[Category:Members of House Frey|Joyeuse Frey]] [[Category:Rivermen]]   [[de:Sonnenschein Erenfurt]] [[es:Joyeuse Erenford]] [[fr:Joyeuse Frey]] [[nl:Joyeuse Erenvoort]] [[ro:Joyeuse Frey]] [[ru:Жойез Эренфорд]] [[zh:乔苏珊·恩佛德]]
