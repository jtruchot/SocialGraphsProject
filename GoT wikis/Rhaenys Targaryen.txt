She is a [[dragonrider]], her mount being [[Meleys]], the Red Queen.   ==Biography== ===Background=== [[File:Jaehaerys and Chest.png|thumb|250px|left|Rhaenys was passed over as Jaehaerys's heir for a second time at the Great Council of 101 AC.]] Rhaenys is the granddaughter of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], the daughter of [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon Targaryen]] and [[Jocelyn Baratheon]], and the first cousin of [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and [[Daemon Targaryen]]. She is named after her great-great-grandmother: [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]], the sister-wife of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].  Rhaenys married [[Corlys Velaryon]], admiral of the Targaryen fleets and currently the wealthiest living man in Westeros, having grown rich on trading expeditions he personally made to the Further East of [[Essos]]. Rhaenys and Corlys have two children: their daughter [[Laena Velaryon]] and son [[Laenor Velaryon]].  Rhaenys's father Aemon died before her grandfather King Jaehaerys did, after which Jaehaerys made the decision to name his ''second'' son, Rhaenys's uncle [[Baelon Targaryen]], as his heir. This proved controversial, since according to traditional inheritance law based on primogeniture, a lord's daughter stands ahead of his younger brother in the line of succession. As a result, Rhaenys is called "The Queen Who Never Was". Baelon himself died a few years later, also while Jaehaerys was still alive, leaving two rival male claimants to the [[Iron Throne]]: Rhaenys's own son Laenor (based on primogeniture), or Rhaenys's first cousin Viserys (the son of her uncle Baelon, and thus an ''unbroken'' male line). Fearing a civil war, Jaehaerys solved the issue by holding the [[Great Council of 101 AC]] in which all the lords of Westeros held a vote, and elected Viserys as heir to the throne. Jaehaerys died of old age a few years later and Viserys ascended to the throne.[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon ''House of the Dragon'' | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com]  ===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]=== [[File:Rhaenys Tourney Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rhaenys at the Heir's Tournament.]] At the [[Heir's Tournament]] held to celebrate the impending birth of Viserys's son [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Viserys I)|Baelon]], Rhaenys comments scathingly to her husband Corlys that the [[Knighthood|knights]] participating are as "green as summer grass" and none have actually seen real battle. When Viserys's wife [[Aemma Arryn]] dies from childbirth complications and Baelon does not long survive her, Rhaenys is among the family members and courtiers present at their joint [[funeral]]."[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]"  Rhaenys and her husband meet with King Viserys and propose a marriage alliance between the widower monarch and their daughter Laena, uniting the greatest surviving houses of [[Old Valyria]]. While Viserys is very hesitant at the idea of marrying a child, he understands the importance of producing more heirs to secure his line. Rhaenys later speaks to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]—Viserys's only surviving child and designated heir to the Iron Throne—and gives her a blunt lesson in politics: as much as the lords of [[Westeros]] have sworn to uphold Rhaenyra's position as her father's heir, she knows from personal experience that such oaths can easily be reneged on, and that having a woman on the throne is a much more controversial prospect than the young princess realizes."[[The Rogue Prince]]"  [[File:OT Rhaenys and Corlys.png|thumb|250px|left|Rhaenys expresses her fear that Laenor is entering a dangerous marriage.]] Viserys arrives at the Velaryon island stronghold of [[High Tide]] to negotiate with Corlys, who had previously resigned as [[Master of Ships]] on the king's [[small council]] over Viserys's decision to marry [[Alicent Hightower]] rather than Laena. Rhaenys seems concerned at the apparently ill health of her cousin, but Viserys dismisses the matter and proposes that his daughter Rhaenyra should marry Laena's brother Laenor, and their firstborn child would someday inherit the Iron Throne. Both sides agree to the terms, but Rhaenys privately confesses to her husband that Laenor's secret preference for men may only cause further complications. She also admits that she made peace long ago with the fact that she wasn't chosen as queen."[[We Light the Way]]"  Stub  ==Appearances== HotD/Season 1 appearances|yes|yes|||yes||yes|yes|yes|yes  ==Family tree== ===Paternal=== HotD/House Targaryen family tree  ===Maternal=== HotD/House Baratheon family tree  ==Quotes== ===Spoken by Rhaenys=== Quote|I understand the order of things.

On February 11, 2021, HBO announced that [[Eve Best]] had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows: Quote|A dragonrider and wife to Lord Corlys Velaryon, "The Queen Who Never Was" was passed over as heir to the throne at the Great Council because the realm favored her cousin, Viserys, simply for being male.|HBO|https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/cast-and-characters/princess-rhaenys-velaryon   There were actually three members of the Targaryen dynasty named "Rhaenys" over the three centuries of their rule. George R.R. Martin intentionally had names repeat like this because it's what happened in the real Middle Ages, i.e. all of the kings and princes in England named "Henry", "Edward", or "William". The [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|first Rhaenys]] was the sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror, while the second Rhaenys - wife of Corlys Velaryon - lived over a century after her death. This second Rhaenys is the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I, the first Rhaenys's grandson. The third Rhaenys was [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]'s first child, with Elia Martell, who was killed during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] when she was only three years old. In the books, the second Rhaenys is usually distinguished by calling her "Rhaenys, daughter of Aemon", "Corlys's wife Rhaenys" etc., or the nickname "Rhaenys, the Queen Who Never Was". The ''House of the Dragon'' TV series seems to have approached clarifying this by simply referring to her by her married surname, "Rhaenys Velaryon". The books never actually call her that, but it is by no means inaccurate - George R.R. Martin himself said that whether married noblewomen drop their maiden name or not is usually up to personal preference, typically keeping their original surname if their family is more prestigious than their husband's. For example, "Cersei Baratheon" is hardly ever used for [[Cersei Lannister]], though it isn't technically incorrect - while "[[Catelyn Stark]]" is also called "Catelyn Tully" more or less interchangeably.  ==In the books== In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Rhaenys Targaryen was the daughter of Prince Aemon Targaryen and Lady Jocelyn Baratheon, born in 74 AC on the seventh day of the seventh month. She was a great beauty with Baratheon black hair and Targaryen pale violet eyes. By the age of fifty-five she had a lean lined face and her hair was streaked with white. She was clever, capable, spirited, proud, fierce, and fearless, with a fiery temperament. In battle, she wore steel and copper armor that flashed in the sun.  Her father was the [[Prince of Dragonstone]], and since she was his firstborn child many considered Rhaenys to be next in line to the [[Iron Throne]]. Her grandmother [[Alysanne Targaryen|Queen Alysanne]] called her "our queen to be."  In 89 AC she joined her grandfather [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|King Jaehaerys I]] for part of his royal progress. She flew to [[Highgarden]] on her [[dragon]] [[Meleys]] to meet up with the king and together they flew to all four of the [[Shield Islands]]. During this trip she informed him of her intention to [[Marriage|marry]] Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] and he gave her his blessing. She married Corlys the following year, arriving at the wedding on Meleys at her own insistence, and two years later she learned that she was pregnant with her first child.  In 92 AC, Rhaenys's father died, and the king was forced to formally appoint a new heir to the throne. Rhaenys's uncle Baelon was chosen as the new heir, causing Rhaenys to protest the decision and her husband Corlys to give up his position as [[lord admiral]] and his place on the [[small council]]. Rhaenys's mother and grandmother were both angered by the decision, as was her uncle [[Boremund Baratheon]].  Rhaenys and Corlys returned to [[Driftmark]] and in 92 AC she gave birth to a daughter, Laena Velaryon, and a son Laenor in 94 AC. Both [[House Velaryon]] and [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]] claimed that Laenor had a stronger claim to the throne, but Baelon remained King Jaehaerys's heir.  Baelon died in 101 AC and King Jaehaerys held a [[Great Council of 101 AC|Great Council at Harrenhal]] to determine the line of succession. Rhaenys and her children were among fourteen claims considered: she and her daughter Laena were rejected on account of their sex, but the final candidates were Viserys and Rhaenys's son Laenor. Rhaenys's uncle Boremund and Lord Ellard Stark were both outspoken in their support of her claim, along with [[House Dustin]] and [[House Manderly]]. Corlys used his wealth to persuade the vassal Houses along the coasts of the [[Narrow Sea|narrow sea]] to support Laenor's claim as well, such as Lords [[House Bar Emmon|Bar Emmon]] and [[House Celtigar|Celtigar]]. In the final vote, however, Baelon's son [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] won by a wide margin: while the ballot was secret, it was rumored that he beat Laenor by a factor of twenty to one. Following this, the [[fool]] Mushroom gave Rhaenys the moniker of "The Queen Who Never Was," which became a popular nickname for her among the commoners.  ==See also== *AWOIAF|Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Aemon) Spoilers|House of the Dragon  ==References== Reflist  ===Notes=== Notelist   HotD/House Targaryen House Velaryon Black Council   DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Rhaenys [[Category:Black Council]] [[Category:Crownlanders]] [[Category:Dragonriders]] [[Category:HotD/Living individuals]] [[Category:Ladies]] [[Category:Members of House Targaryen|Rhaenys Targaryen]] [[Category:Members of House Velaryon|Rhaenys Targaryen]] [[Category:Princesses]] [[Category:Regents]]   [[de:Rhaenys Targaryen (Königin der Herzen)]] [[es:Rhaenys Targaryen, hija de Aemon/House of the Dragon]] [[fr:Rhaenys Targaryen (la Reine qui ne le Fut Jamais)]] [[it:Rhaenys Targaryen (figlia di Aemon)]] [[pl:Rhaenys Targaryen (Królowa, Której Nie Było)]] [[pt-br:Rhaenys Velaryon]] [[ru:Рейнис Таргариен]] [[zh:雷妮丝·坦格利安(伊蒙之女)]]
