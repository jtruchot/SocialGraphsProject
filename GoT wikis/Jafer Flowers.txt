His body was found and returned to [[Castle Black]].   ==Biography== ===Background=== Jafer Flowers is a ranger in the Night's Watch. His name, Flowers, suggests that he was a [[Bastardy|bastard]] from the [[Reach]] before joining the Watch. He and [[Othor]] accompanied [[Benjen Stark]]'s ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafer and Othor are killed while on this mission.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== [[Jon Snow]]'s [[direwolf]], [[Ghost]], finds Jafer's severed hand in the [[Haunted Forest]]."[[You Win or You Die]]" The corpses of Othor and the rest of Jafer Flowers are found [[beyond the Wall]] by [[Samwell Tarly]], Jon and a party led by [[Othell Yarwyck]]. They return the corpses to Castle Black and suggest they be burned, but [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] Jeor Mormont decides to let Maester [[Aemon]] examine them first."[[The Pointy End]]"  At night, the corpses rise as [[wight]]s. While Othor attacks Lord Commander Mormont, Flowers causes trouble elsewhere before being put down and burned. Both bodies are re-burned the next day, to be sure. Samwell notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the [[White Walkers]] can animate the dead.  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|8=yes  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jafer Flowers's background is the same as in the show.   Jafer's wight attacked the main castle garrison. It killed five men, among them Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]], and continued to attack even after having its head cut off - it was only subdued after being chopped to pieces by a dozen swordsmen.  Unlike in the series, when the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes - different from the eye color they had in their lives.  Jafer's severed hand, which was torn by Ghost, continued to twitch and stir long after Jafer was destroyed. [[Alliser Thorne]] took it to [[King's Landing]], but it had rotted away while he was waiting for an audience.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Watch navbox   DEFAULTSORT:Flowers, Jafer [[Category:Bastards]] [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Rangers of the Night's Watch]] [[Category:Reachmen]] [[Category:Wights]]   [[de:Jafer Blumen]] [[es:Jafer Flores]] [[fr:Jafer Flowers]] [[nl:Jafer Bloemen]] [[pl:Jafer Flowers]] [[ru:Джафер Флауэрс]] [[zh:杰佛·佛花]]
