Mycah manages to escape, but later is killed by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] at Joffrey's orders, much to [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]'s disdain.

He falls in with King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s party as it returns to [[King's Landing]] from [[Winterfell]] and befriends [[Arya Stark]].  After the Hound defeats [[Beric Dondarrion]], he teases Arya by telling her (without the slightest remorse or regret) "I rode him [Mycah] down and cut him in half, and laughed".  Sansa does not care at all about Mycah's death. On the contrary, on one accasion she teases Arya by telling that Mycah attacked Joffrey (contradicting her previous lies that she didn't remember what happened, because the event occurred too fast).   According to [[Jeyne Poole]], Mycah has been cut up in so many pieces that his body was brought back to his father in a bag; at first the poor man had thought it was a slaughtered pig.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Smallfolk]]   [[de:Mycah]] [[ru:Мика]] [[zh:米凯]]
