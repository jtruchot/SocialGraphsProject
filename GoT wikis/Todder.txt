Even then, the actor wasn't identified by name to be playing Todder until Season 5's episode "Hardhome".  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Todder is the son of a winesink owner. He is described as a short, ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. He has pig eyes, small and shiny. Instead of a Builder, Toad is made a [[Ranger]]. He is among the friends that prevent Jon from abandoning the Night's Watch and joining [[Robb Stark]].  In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Toad complains about [[Melisandre]]'s preaching, that she calls the Seven and the old gods false gods, and made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. Later, Jon sends him to serve at the [[Shadow Tower]].  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Night's Watch   [[Category:Living individuals]] [[Category:Westerosi]]   [[ru:Тоддер]] [[zh:陶德]]
