While Irri and the other two tend to Daenerys in the tent, Daenerys asks them if they have seen dragons. Irri states that dragons are gone. She is also very skeptical of Doreah's story of dragons coming from a long-destroyed second moon. Irri insists that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims. Jhiqui sides with Irri but Daenerys is intrigued by Doreah's "dragon egg" story and asks Irri and Jhiqui to leave her alone with Doreah."[[The Kingsroad]]" [[File:Lord Snow Irri Dany pregnant.png|thumb|Irri discovers that Daenerys is pregnant.]] Irri acts as a translator between Daenerys and her bodyguard [[Rakharo]]. Rakharo protects Daenerys from one of her brother [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]]'s famous rages by whipping him around his throat, though he respects Daenerys's request not to kill him. Irri and Rakharo show mutual puzzlement at her mercy. Irri determines that Daenerys is pregnant and arranges a special dinner to celebrate. Irri tells [[Jorah Mormont]] about Daenerys's pregnancy as she demands Rakharo to find something different than horseflesh for the meal."[[Lord Snow]]"  Irri tends to Doreah after Viserys beats her."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]" Irri burns her hands when she tries to handle a dragon egg Daenerys has put into a fire pit, Daenerys was holding the egg without it affecting her. Irri is present when Viserys threatens Daenerys and her baby and translates his words to Drogo. Irri watches as Viserys is killed by the Khal using molten gold to avoid spilling blood in Vaes Dothrak."[[A Golden Crown]]"  [[File:Daenerys, Irri & Doreah 1x07.png|thumb|Irri, as part of Daenerys's retinue, inspects the markets of Vaes Dothrak.]] Irri is part of Daenerys's retinue as she inspects the markets of [[Vaes Dothrak]].

Jorah approaches the horse and discovers Rakharo's severed head. She is devastated because, according to Dohtraki belief, unless his body is cremated Rakharo's spirit won't be able to move on to the Night Lands (the afterlife) to ride with his ancestors. Irri is comforted by Daenerys, who tells her that tonight Rakharo will ride with them."[[The Night Lands]]" Irri was in love with Rakharo.[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rakharo/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rakharo entry] [[File:Qarth walls.jpg|thumb|Irri and the horde arrive at Qarth.]] At Qarth, Daenerys joins Irri by her bed and Irri describes the repairs she has made to Daenerys’s clothes. Daenerys thanks Irri, calling her friend. Doreah picks up a dress from the bed and asks if Daenerys has seen it. She tells her Xaro had it made for her and reports hearing that he is the wealthiest man in Qarth. Irri concurs with her fellow handmaiden. Doreah adds that Qarth is the richest city in Essos. Daenerys recalls her gift from [[Illyrio Mopatis]], saying that the last time a rich man gave her a gown it was because he intended to sell her into marriage with Drogo. Irri offers a Dothraki prayer for Drogo to ride forever in the night lands. Daenerys tells Doreah that they know nothing about their host and suggests that men often speak about other men when they are happy, suggesting that Doreah seduce some of Xaro’s fellow citizens to obtain more information. Doreah says that Daenerys would look like a real princess in Xaro’s dress and Irri objects to the title, correcting Doreah that Daenerys is a Khaleesi. Irri breaks the ensuing awkward silence by encouraging Daenerys to wear the dress as a guest’s courtesy to Xaro. When Xaro throws a reception for Daenerys in his gardens, Irri and several of the khalasar are also present."[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"  [[File:Irrii Killed Season2.png|thumb|Irri's body in Xaro Xhoan Daxos's manse]] Daenerys discovers that some of her Khalasar have been murdered.

It must be remembered that this is from a deleted scene and thus it is not canonical and is not officially considered to have actually happened. Exactly why the scene was deleted, whether for plot reasons or simply for time constraints, has not been revealed.  Amrita Acharia gave another interview after her departure, noting that the death scene filmed for Irri actually gave her real bruises, “I think it’s hard to be strangled onscreen because obviously to an extent to make it look real, you really have to be a bit strangled. So I had massive bruises on my neck the next day. I was proud. Battle scars. Death scenes are fun."[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/interview-with-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsComing.net interview with Amrita Acharia]  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Irri is a Dothraki slave given to Daenerys by Drogo to teach her how to ride. She is ethnically a Dothraki, but was enslaved when her own ''khalasar'' was defeated by another. She is the same age as Daenerys, and is fond of using the Dothraki saying, "It is known."  Irri is usually seen paired with Daenerys's other handmaiden [[Jhiqui]]. In the TV series, however, Jhiqui only appeared briely in one scene during Season 1, it seems that the TV series has functionally condensed both into one character.  In the books, Irri survives the journey through the Red Waste and the stay in Qarth, and continues to serve Daenerys during her campaign in [[Slaver's Bay]] and her reign in [[Meereen]].  In the fifth novel, Jhiqui and Irri both develop a crush on Rakharo, who has grown more tall and muscular. They argue whom he would prefer.  Following Daenerys's departure from Meereen, Jhiqui and Irri accompany the Dothraki search parties, dispatched across the [[Skahazadhan]] to locate their queen.  ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist   House Targaryen   [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Dothraki]] [[Category:Handmaidens]] [[Category:Servants and retainers of House Targaryen]]   [[de:Irri]] [[es:Irri]] [[fr:Irri]] [[it:Irri]] [[pl:Irri]] [[ru:Ирри]] [[zh:伊丽]]
