His rule is currently disputed by his older half-sister, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is the firstborn son of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and his second wife, Queen [[Alicent Hightower]]. He is the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Sunfyre]].[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/dragon-index#sunfyre House of the Dragon Dragon Index: Sunfyre]  ==Biography== ===Background=== Aegon was born in [[Timeline#House of the Dragon|113 AC]], roughly a year after his parents marriage in King’s Landing and the tenth year of his father’s rule. He has an elder half-sister, Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], the daughter of King Viserys's first wife, Queen [[Aemma Arryn]], and three younger full siblings through his mother Alicent: Princess [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]].   Until his sudden ascension to the throne orchestrated by the [[Green Council]], Aegon was seventh-in-line to succeed to the [[Iron Throne]], after Rhaenyra and her five children and his half-nephews, Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon]], and Princes [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Daemon)|Aegon Targaryen the Younger]] and Prince [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Daemon)|Viserys Targaryen]].  ===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]=== [[File:SOHN Aegon and Viserys.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon on his second nameday.]] The realm celebrates Aegon's second [[nameday]] with a royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]]. During a gathering shortly before the hunt, [[Hobert Hightower]] pressures his brother [[Otto Hightower|Otto]]—who serves as the [[Hand of the King]]—to convince Viserys to name Aegon his heir. Hobert later openly hails the prince as "Aegon the Conqueror-Babe, Second of His Name."  During the outing, the [[Royal Huntsman]] tracks a [[white hart]], considered a [[magic]]al creature and a symbol of royalty, contributing to Viserys's doubts about previously naming Rhaenyra his heir in a very public ceremony. To the king's relief, however, the stag that they finally catch is not a white one.  When Otto proposes a marriage between Aegon and Rhaenyra, this at first amuses then angers the king, who is already exhausted with the constant politicking by his [[small council]] and the other lords present, including [[Jason Lannister]] who brazenly declares his assumption that Aegon will soon be named heir.  The day after the hunt, Otto pressures Alicent to discuss the succession with Viserys. She does not bring up the subject in her next conversation with him, however."[[Second of His Name]]"  [[File:KOTNS Mummer's Farce Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mummers spread the sentiment that Aegon is the rightful heir.]] The following year, Rhaenyra and her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] watch a [[Mummers|mummer's farce]] about the succession performed on the [[Street of Silk]] in [[King's Landing]]. The majority of the spectators appear to favor Aegon as heir, echoing the lead mummer's question that Rhaenyra would be a feeble queen."[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]"  After being dismissed as [[Hand of the King]], Otto bluntly tells Alicent that if Rhaenyra inherits the throne, war will follow and Alicent and her children will be put to the sword. He urges her to prepare Aegon to rule."[[We Light the Way]]"  Ten years later, a now teenaged Aegon accompanies his brother Aemond and Rhaenyra's sons Jacaerys and Lucerys Velaryon to the [[Dragonpit]], and watches as Jace is trained by the [[Dragonkeepers]] to command his young dragon [[Vermax]]. Aegon, Jace, and Luke tell Aemond, the only boy yet without a [[dragon]], that they found one for him. The three boys then bring out a pig that they have decorated with wings and make fun of Aemond with squealing noises. Aegon is later scolded in private by his mother, who tells him that he must treat his brother respectfully in public, for one day he will be king. When Aegon claims that he has no plans to challenge Rhaenyra's succession, Alicent rebukes him, telling her son that he himself already is the challenge, and that Rhaenyra will have to kill him and his brother to secure her claim."[[The Princess and the Queen]]"  [[File:TPATQ Aegon and Jacaerys.png|thumb|250px|left|Aegon fights Jace.]] Aegon later trains in the courtyard of the [[Red Keep]] alongside Aemond, Jace, and Luke under Ser [[Criston Cole]]. Aegon demonstrates proficiency with a sword against a strawman, but he and Aemond are easily bested by Criston. Criston later has Aegon knock Jace to the ground and relentlessly attack him, but Ser [[Harwin Strong]] intervenes, grabbing Aegon and pushing him aside, angering the young [[prince]].  [[File:Aegon and Aemond Driftmark.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon laments his betrothal to his sister, Helaena.]] Aegon is present alongside Viserys, Alicent, Helaena, Aemond, and the rest of the royal family for the funeral of his aunt, [[Laena Velaryon]], at [[Driftmark]]. During the funeral reception after, Aegon and his brother watch their sister Helaena study a spider, and they argue over Aegon's betrothal to and dislike of their sister, with him stating Helaena is an idiot and that they have nothing in common. Aemond defends Helaena by reminding Aegon that she is their sister and his future queen. When Aegon suggests Aemond should marry Helaena if he is willing to defend her, Aemond says that if he were betrothed to Helaena, he would do his duty to keep their Valyrian blood pure. Aegon finishes the argument by quipping that he and Helaena do share at least an attraction to things with long legs, before grabbing more wine and leaving to flirt with a servant."[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]"  Aegon continues to get drunk on wine through the funeral reception into the evening. He is eventually found by his grandfather, Ser Otto Hightower, inebriated on a flight of steps near the reception area. Exasperated at his behavior, Otto roughly grabs Aegon, who in his drunken confusion believes him to be his brother. Otto then drags Aegon back to the reception area and sends him to bed, while his brother Aemond and the assembled court look on.  [[File:DM Aegon and Viserys I Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon confesses to his father that everyone knows about the illegitimacy of Rhaenyra's children.]] Later that evening, Aegon is present in the [[Hall of Nine]] with his mother and sister, as Aemond's eye injury is tended to by [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Kelvyn]], while Viserys angrily questions his [[Kingsguard]] how they allowed the fight between his son and his grandchildren and nieces to happen. Alicent then angrily confronts Aegon on where he was before slapping and reprimanding him for getting drunk while his brother was harmed. When calls on Aemond to tell him where he heard the rumors about Jace and Luke's parentage, Aemond reluctantly says Aegon told him, baffling Aegon. When Viserys questions Aegon on where he heard the rumors, Aegon's only defense to his father's questioning is that everyone knows based on Jace and Luke's non-Valyrian features.  The following day, Aegon departs with his family from Driftmark, riding on his dragon Sunfyre, alongside Helaena on [[Dreamfyre]] and Aemond on [[Vhagar]] as they return home to King's Landing.  At some point after this, Aegon and Helaena are wed to each other and have two children, [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]]."[[The Lord of the Tides]]"  Six years after Laena's funeral, Aegon rapes a household servant named [[Dyana]] as she is serving him wine. Furious, Alicent goes to see her son, who is lying in bed naked and heavily drunk. When Aegon says that he viewed it as "harmless fun" and that Dyana did not need to get upset, Alicent yells at him to stop with his womanizing as he is shaming their family. Aegon accuses his mother of wanting too much from him, and that despite how much pressure she and his father put on him, it will never be enough for them.  [[File:TLOTT Criston, Aegon, Aemond, Helaena, Alicent & Otto.png|thumb|250px|right|Aegon with his family in the Great Hall.]] Later, Aegon and his family hear the petitions of [[Vaemond Velaryon]] and Rhaenyra, on behalf of Lucerys, over the succession to Driftmark. Aegon smiles when Viserys reaffirms Lucerys's right to Driftmark and is surprised when his uncle Daemon kills Vaemond for calling Rhaenyra's sons bastards.  [[File:TLOTT Lucerys & Aegon.png|thumb|250px|left|Aegon drunkenly brawls with Luke.]] Viserys gets the entire Targaryen family together for dinner that night. Fed up with Aegon, Alicent toasts Rhaenyra and says that she will be a fine queen. Aegon harasses Jace about his betrothal to their cousin [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], joking that he can teach Jace about sex. When Aegon goes to flirt with Baela, Jace stands up but quickly calms himself and toasts his uncles. Helaena adds in, toasting Baela and Rhaena and indirectly taunting Aegon about their marriage. Aegon is further annoyed when Jace dances with Helaena. At the end of the feast, when a fight breaks out between Aemond and Jace, Aegon joins in by hitting Luke's head against the table before Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon break the fight up.  On his deathbed, Viserys, thinking he is talking to Rhaenyra, tells Alicent that [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]]'s [[The Song of Ice and Fire|prophetic dream]] is true and that she will be the one to save the realm. Believing that Viserys means their son, Alicent is reinvigorated in her goal to get Aegon on the throne.  What Alicent does not know, however, is that members of the [[small council]], including her father, have been plotting to put Aegon on the throne for years despite Viserys's steadfast support of Rhaenyra. When their plans are complete, the king-to-be is nowhere to be found. Otto sends [[Arryk Cargyll|Arryk]] and [[Erryk Cargyll]] to find Aegon and bring the prince to him, while Alicent sends Criston Cole and Aemond to find him for the same purpose."[[The Green Council]]"  [[File:TGC Aegon's bastard.png|thumb|250px|right|A bastard child fathered by Aegon.]] While in a fighting pit that enslaves young children, Arryk and Erryk find a child who they believe is one of Aegon's bastards. Eventually, they are approached by [[Jayne]], a woman who claims to know where Aegon is, and they are taken to her employer [[Mysaria]], also known as the White Worm. She reveals to Otto that she orchestrated the kidnapping of Aegon the previous night, and tells the Cargylls where to find him in exchange for the Crown cracking down on the child fighting pits.  [[File:TGC Aemond and Aegon Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon attempts to flee being crowned.]] They travel to the [[Grand Sept]], where they find Aegon asleep underneath a shrine. When they go outside with the drunken prince to bring him to Otto, they are stopped by Criston and Aemond, who had picked up their trail. Aegon tries to escape, but Aemond tackles him. Aegon is shocked to learn from his brother that his mother and her allies have plotted to make him king, and expresses his wish to leave Westeros to stay out of everyone's political games. When Aemond puts him in a headlock, Aegon loudly pronounces that he is unfit to rule and he doesn't want the crown.  [[File:TGC Aegon and Alicent Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon and Alicent on their way to the coronation.]] Regardless of his wishes, Aegon's coronation takes place the next day in the Dragonpit. On the way there, he questions his mother on whether Viserys's alleged wish for Aegon to succeed him is genuine, as he had refused to name Aegon his heir for twenty years, even over the blood of his relatives. Alicent presents him with Viserys's [[Valyrian steel dagger]], but Aegon, after being told not to kill Rhaenyra as Otto wishes, asks if his mother truly loves him, to which she replies "you imbecile."  [[File:TGC Aegon II Coronation Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon relishes in the cheers of the smallfolk as he is crowned.]] Aegon is anointed by [[Septon]] [[Eustace]] and crowned by Criston Cole with his ancestor Aegon the Conqueror's [[crown]] as King Aegon II, usurping Rhaenyra. He turns to see the crowd cheering for him. He draws [[Blackfyre]], the ancestral sword of House Targaryen, and starts to celebrate his new, previously unwanted, kingship. But at that point, Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] bursts through the floor astride her dragon [[Meleys]], and Alicent steps in front of Aegon to protect him, but Rhaenys spares Aegon and his family and flees to [[Dragonstone]] to warn Rhaenyra.  Following his coronation, Aegon adopts a green three-headed dragon as his new royal standard, in honor of his mother's family. Ser Otto Hightower is dispatched to deliver terms of surrender to Rhaenyra and Daemon on Dragonstone, and flies the kings new banner on his sails."[[The Black Queen]]"  ==Appearances== HotD/Season 1 appearances|||yes|||yes|yes|yes|yes  ==Family tree== ===Paternal=== HotD/House Targaryen family tree  ===Maternal=== HotD/House Hightower family tree  ==Quotes== ===Spoken by Aegon=== Quote|Oh, it was just harmless fun.|Aegon, to Alicent, about Dyana|The Lord of the Tides Quote|I have no wish to rule!

The character breakdown reads as follows: Quote|The first-born son of King Viserys.|HBO|https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/cast-and-characters   ==In the books==  In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Aegon II Targaryen was the first child of Viserys I Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. He had an older half-sister, Rhaenyra.  Aegon, named after [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], was born in 106 AC at King's Landing. When he ascended the throne, he adopted his own royal standard: a golden dragon on a black field, in honor of his dragon, Sunfyre the Golden. In ''House of the Dragon'', the dragon on his standard is green rather than gold.  ==See also== *AWOIAF Spoilers|House of the Dragon  ==References== Reflist  ===Notes=== Notelist   HotD/House Targaryen HotD/Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men   DEFAULTSORT:Targaryen, Aegon II [[Category:Crownlanders]] [[Category:Dragonriders]] [[Category:Greens]] [[Category:HotD/Living individuals]] [[Category:Kings of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men]] [[Category:Members of House Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] [[Category:Princes]]   [[de:Aegon Targaryen (Sohn von Viserys I.)]] [[es:Aegon II Targaryen/House of the Dragon]] [[fr:Aegon II Targaryen]] [[it:Aegon II Targaryen]] [[pl:Aegon II Targaryen]] [[pt-br:Aegon II Targaryen]] [[ru:Эйгон II Таргариен]] [[zh:伊耿·坦格利安二世]]
