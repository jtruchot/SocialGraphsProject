If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing!|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] referring to Viserion's death.|The Dragon and the Wolf '''Viserion''' was one of the three [[dragon]]s born in the wastelands beyond [[Lhazar]], along with [[Drogon]] and [[Rhaegal]]. He was named after [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s elder brother, [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]]. He could be distinguished by his cream and gold colored scales, and red-orange wings. Eventually, he became an ice dragon[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-7/episode-7 ''Game of Thrones'' Viewer's Guide: Season 7, Episode 7 Synopsis: The Dragon and the Wolf] (although different from [[Ice dragon|the ones of legend]]), and was enslaved by the [[Night King]]. He was also able to breathe fire that was capable of [[Breaching of the Wall|melting]] the [[Wall]], though it was blue in color."[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"   ==Biography== ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== [[File:Dragon Eggs.png|thumb|Viserion, the middle, cream-colored dragon egg.]] Daenerys is given three dragons eggs by [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]] on the occasion of her wedding to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]."[[Winter Is Coming]]" She is drawn to these eggs and always keeps them in a chest with her. Viserys tries to steal them but is stopped by [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Jorah Mormont]]."[[A Golden Crown]]"  Viserion is born along with his two siblings after Daenerys has their eggs placed on the funeral pyre erected for Drogo. As she rises unharmed from the ashes of the pyre on the morning following the funeral, he climbs on her leg."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]=== [[File:Daenerys and dragons 2x10.png|thumb|Viserion (far right) and his brothers burn [[Pyat Pree]].]] Viserion is not shown as much, until he is stolen by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], along with Drogon and Rhaegal. When Daenerys enters the [[House of the Undying]] to retrieve them, she eventually finds her three dragons chained. [[Pyat Pree]] attempts to chain her with [[magic]], claiming that her dragons make his magic strong and that she makes them stronger; thus she will stay with them for an eternity. Daenerys whispers to her dragons, "dracarys," her command to breathe fire; the three of them proceed to burn Pyat Pree alive, releasing them from his magic.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]=== [[File:Dragons at Yunkai.png|thumb|Rhaegal, Drogon, and Viserion at Yunkai.]] Viserion, along with his brothers, accompanies Daenerys on her journey from [[Astapor]] and [[Yunkai]]. When Daenerys has a meeting with a [[Razdal mo Eraz]], of the [[Wise Masters]] of Yunkai, Viserion fights over a piece of meat with his brothers when Daenerys makes a show of force to intimidate Razdal."[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]" After Daenerys frees the [[Slavery|slaves]] of Yunkai, Viserion takes to the sky with his siblings at Daenerys's command; a show of both power and freedom."[[Mhysa]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]=== [[File:Dragons imprisoned.png|thumb|Viserion and Rhaegal are imprisoned by Daenerys. ]] Viserion is seen with his brother Rhaegal fighting over a dead lamb. Drogon, who is now visibly bigger than them, quickly takes the lamb as his brothers squeal for him to share. He sets the corpse down and the three begin to eat."[[Two Swords]]" In response to Drogon's killing of [[Zalla|a three-year-old girl]], Daenerys leads Viserion and Rhaegal into the catacombs of [[Meereen]], where she chains them up."[[The Children]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]=== [[File:Rhaegal_&_Viserion_5x01.png|thumb|Viserion breathes fire to push away Daenerys.]] Daenerys finally decides to reenter the catacombs in an attempt to regain control over her dragons. Rhaegal and Viserion, who have grown even larger during their time in captivity, immediately lash out and breathe fire at the sight of their mother who imprisoned them."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Sometime later, Daenerys, reeling over the death of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], arrests the leaders of Meereen's great families and brings them to meet Rhaegal and Viserion. Rhaegal roasts [[Great Master 1 (Kill the Boy)|one of nobles]] and tucks in, sharing the meal with Viserion. Her point proven, Daenerys leaves, sarcastically saying that she doesn't want to overfeed the dragons."[[Kill the Boy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]=== In the [[Great Pyramid]], [[Tyrion Lannister]] learns that Rhaegal and Viserion have not been eating anything ever since their mother had left. He decides to free them, knowing that they will be better off that way. [[File:Dragons_and_fleet_end_s6.jpg|thumb|Viserion free and flying with his siblings, along with the fleet to Westeros.]] Accompanied by [[Varys]], Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters Rhaegal and Viserion for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them, all the while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his [[nameday]], only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his [[House Lannister|family]] and the cold truth from his [[Tywin Lannister|father]]. Once free, the dragons immediately move deeper into the catacombs while Tyrion quickly exits with Varys."[[Home]]"  After Daenerys returns to Meereen and pits Drogon against the [[Ships|fleet]] assembled by Astapor, Yunkai, and [[Volantis]], Rhaegal and Viserion break out of the catacombs and join their mother and brother in destroying the slavers' fleet with dragonfire, decisively breaking the [[Second Siege of Meereen]]. This defeat marks the end of the attempt to reintroduce slavery to Meereen."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  Sometime later, Viserion and his brothers accompany their mother and her large army on a voyage to [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|retake]] [[Westeros]] by soaring above the armada."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]=== [[File:Viserion_brought_down.jpg|thumb|Viserion is brought down by the Night King.]] Viserion and his brothers fly ahead to investigate [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] while their mother proceeds there by boat."[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"  Upon [[Jon Snow]]'s arrival at Dragonstone, Viserion and his brothers fly overhead and visibly scare both him and [[Davos Seaworth]]. Tyrion then comments that he has not yet gotten used to them either.  Later, Daenerys tells Jon that both Viserion and Rhaegal were named for her deceased brothers, Viserys and [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], respectively."[[The Queen's Justice]]" [[File:Viserion-in-beyond-the-wall.jpg|thumb|Viserion is raised as a wight.]]  Viserion accompanies Daenerys, Rhaegal, and Drogon as they attempt to rescue Jon Snow and his expedition force from the [[White Walkers]] and the [[Wight|army of the dead]] at the [[Wight Hunt]] [[beyond the Wall]]. Viserion and his brothers burn and destroy many of the wights while Jon and his party mount Drogon with Daenerys and the captured wight. Not long after they arrive, however, the [[Night King]] is given an ice spear by another [[White Walker 2 (Beyond the Wall)|White Walker]], and then hurls it at Viserion. The spear pierces the dragon's neck, causing blood and fire to erupt from the fatal wound. With a screech of agony that mingles with his brothers' cries, the helpless dragon crashes into the frozen lake and sinks into the water.  Later, Viserion's corpse is hauled up from the lake by the wights, and is resurrected by the Night King, becoming an ice dragon, his eyes glowing with the same blue tint as the White Walkers and wights."[[Beyond the Wall]]"  With Viserion as his [[Dragonrider|mount]], the Night King leads his army to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. There Viserion blasts the [[Wall]] with blue fire, eventually destroying the castle and the easternmost portion of the Wall, allowing the army of the dead to [[Breaching of the Wall|pass]] into the [[Seven Kingdoms]].  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]=== [[File:Viserion_vs_rhaegal.png|thumb|Rhaegal fights Viserion above Winterfell.]] Viserion is seen during the [[Great War]] being ridden by the Night King. During the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], his flames destroy one of the walls of [[Winterfell]] and the people within it.  [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], mounted on [[Rhaegal]] and [[Drogon]] respectively, engage the undead dragon and his rider in a ferocious battle, which leaves Viserion severely maimed when Rhaegal rips off part of his lower jaw and neck.  After Rhaegal retreats, having sustained serious injuries, Drogon drops from above and rams Viserion, knocking the Night King off his mount. Even riderless, Viserion descends into Winterfell's courtyard to wreak havoc there.  While Jon Snow fights his way through Winterfell trying to reach [[Bran Stark|Bran]], he is spotted by the dragon and is almost killed by blue fire. As Jon comes out of hiding, Viserion readies himself to kill him, but [[Arya Stark]] kills the Night King, severing the magic used to reanimate him and causing the dragon to drop dead instantly."[[The Long Night]]"  The death of Viserion, along with those of Jorah, Rhaegal, and Missandei, causes Daenerys Targaryen to give into her grief and [[Battle of King's Landing|burn]] the majority of [[King's Landing]]."[[The Bells]]"  ==Personality and traits== The majority of Viserion's scales were golden, with cream colored markings under his neck and tail, and white horns and spines. His wings were red orange, with black tints along the bones. He had green eyes. Viserion is not as aggressive as Drogon, he is a more calm dragon much like Rhaegal. However, he can show ferocity if needed and will undoubtedly defend his mother from any enemy menacing her. Daenerys has trained him to respond to vocal commands in her mother tongue of [[High Valyrian]], especially "''Dracarys''" (High Valyrian for dragonfire), to which Viserion responds by instantly breathing fire and burning anything in his path. Being a dragon, Viserion, has an immense physical strength and can spit destructive streams of fire. He can also fly extremely high and at great speeds, more than any other animal.  After becoming an ice dragon, Viserion's eyes turned blue, characteristic of White Walkers and their wights. His scales have seemingly lost their golden color, now appearing more deathly blue, his wings are torn and tattered in several places, and his horns have lost their bony color and resemble the white icicles crowning his master. Given the supernatural nature of dragons, this may be his body reacting to the Night King's magic. Unlike his living version, he can spit blue fire, powerful enough to demolish a part of the Wall with a single breath. Undead Viserion has also demonstrate strength enough to maintain a battle against Drogon and Rhaegal mounted by Daenerys and Jon respectively, heavily wounding Rhaegal in the process.  In addition, the undead Viserion, during the fight with Rhaegal and Drogon, is disfigured on the left side of the face and gets deep wounds around the neck, from which uncontrolled flames come out, as well as from the mouth.  As a wight dragon, Viserion no longer possesses free will. He only follows the Night King's commands like any other wight in the Army of the Dead.  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 1 appearances|10=yes GoT/Season 2 appearances|yes|||||||||yes GoT/Season 3 appearances|1=yes|4=yes|7=yes|10=yes GoT/Season 4 appearances|yes|||||||||yes GoT/Season 5 appearances|yes||||yes||||| GoT/Season 6 appearances|2 = yes|9 = yes|10=yes GoT/Season 7 appearances|yes|3 = yes| 4 = yes| 5 = yes|6 = yes|7 = yes GoT/Season 8 appearances|3 = yes  ==Gallery==  Daenerys and dragons 2x10.jpg|Viserion and his siblings cling to their "mother".

His primary coloration is specifically cream, though he is often referred to as simply the "white" dragon.  Daenerys named Viserion after her brother [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]]. As she explained, "Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my brother still. His dragon will do what he could not."  Viserion's name wasn't mentioned on-screen as of the end of [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]], though it was stated in the Season 4 HBO Viewer's Guide, establishing that his name is the same in the TV continuity.[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-4/episode-10/houses/5/house-targaryen] His name was finally stated on-screen (alongside Rhaegal's name) in [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]] episode 1, "[[The Wars To Come]]".  Daenerys refers to her three dragons as "brothers", but as the exact origin of the eggs is never addressed, there is actually no reason to think that their eggs were all laid by the same dragon, or if the three eggs were even found in the same place (even if they are all from the [[Shadow Lands]], that region is at least as large as [[Dorne]]). She may call them "brothers" more in the figurative sense that they were raised together.  In contrast to his namesake, Viserion is noted as being the best behaved of Daenerys's three dragons, even compared to his brother Rhaegal. Viserion in several ways seems to act like the bashful youngest brother of Daenerys's three dragons, the least violent, yet most friendly to other people besides Daenerys herself. When the three dragons are hunting, Drogon moves in for the kill first, because he is the largest, eating his fill before letting the others get a chance; Rhaegal isn't as large or strong, but relies on cunning, waiting to see when Drogon lets his guard down to come in from a side angle and snag some meat before Drogon is finished. Both Drogon and Rhaegal turn totally silent right before they are about to attack, so they don't surprise their prey and make them flee. Viserion, meanwhile, just charges directly at his prey, excitedly making as much noise as possible, sometimes scaring them off due to his lack of skill. He also isn't patient enough to wait for Drogon to let his guard down and snag some food the way Rhaegal does: he angrily approaches Drogon directly, but then gets scared off by Drogon again and again when he gets too close (almost like a pack of three dogs fighting over scraps: an alpha, a middle-sized dog, and a runt). Nonetheless, Viserion is still a dragon, and despite his sometimes clumsy hunting style he becomes very deadly to humans as he grows, dangerous enough to threaten entire armies.  In the third novel, Viserion has grown to the size of a small dog, like Rhaegal, a bit smaller than Drogon. Viserion grows fond of Brown Ben Plumm, the new commander of the Second Sons, sometimes landing on his shoulder. Ben tells Daenerys humorously that it is no wonder, for he has some dragon blood himself.  During the fifth novel, Daenerys is so busy ruling Meereen, that she neglects the dragons. Like any wild beast that is left to grow without proper training, all three grow savage and unrestrained; first they prey on sheep and goats, causing significant losses to shepherds. Only after a [[Zalla#In the books|little girl]] is killed by Drogon, Daenerys realizes the dragons pose a great danger to her subjects, and must be kept locked in a makeshift dragon pit, large enough to hold 500 men, inside the Great Pyramid.  Viserion is the easiest to be chained up: Daenerys feeds him morsels of charred meat from her own hand, then leads him to the pit herself and shuts him up inside with several oxen; once he gorges himself, he grows drowsy, and Daenerys's servants chain him while he sleeps. Rhaegal is more difficult to restrain, perhaps because he heard Viserion raging in the pit, and Drogon flies away.  As the Yunkai troops and their sellswords draw closer to Meereen, Ben Plumm urges Daenerys to use Rhaegal and Viserion, but she reluctantly declines for a reason she cannot reveal - that she has lost control over them. As a result, the Second Sons switch sides.  Daenerys has Viserion and Rhaegal fed and visits them occasionally. As time passes, they break their chains and dig holes in the walls, though they still cannot exit the pit. When Daenerys comes with Quentyn Martell to visit them, she becomes worried that eventually they will break through the walls.  After Daenerys and Drogon leave Meereen, Quentyn seeks to steal Viserion and Rhaegal. The attempt costs his life, and the dragons finally get loose.  Viserion and Rhaegal terrorize the city, killing and eating people. They destroy the pyramid of Hazkar, then make the pyramids of Yherizan and Uhlez their lairs. Many of the Meereenese who reside in those pyramids are killed, either by the dragons' fire or crushed under the debris; the survivors find themselves homeless and penniless. Hundreds of people flee the city for any refuge that will have them; many others have lost all hope. In order to minimize the danger the dragons pose, Ser Barristan Selmy orders to fill the fighting pits with large amounts of sheep and bullocks, which seems to satisfy the dragons and make them less eager to feast on human flesh.  While making plans for the battle against the besieging armies, Selmy takes into consideration that Viserion and Rhaegal will undoubtedly arrive at the battlefield, drawn by the noises of battle and scent of blood, and probably attack both parties indiscriminately. Selmy hopes, though, that the sight of the dragons will demoralize the enemy troops.  During the ensuing battle between the defenders of Meereen and the besiegers, Viserion and Rhaegal are flying overhead. At the camp of the Second Sons, Tyrion watches Viserion as he roasts and consumes the corpses being thrown by one of the catapults. By the time Ben Plumm returns to the camp, Viserion flies back to his lair above Meereen.  By the point the novels reached, Viserion is still alive.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Dragons   [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Dragons of House Targaryen]] [[Category:Wights]]   [[de:Viserion]] [[es:Viserion]] [[fr:Viserion]] [[nl:Viserion]] [[pl:Viserion]] [[pt-br:Viserion]] [[ru:Визерион]] [[zh:韦赛利昂]]
