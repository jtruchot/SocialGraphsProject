Despite his youth, his savagery and success in battle have seen him rise high amongst the hill tribes.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is captured by [[Shagga]] and the [[Stone Crows]] while traversing the Vale. Tyrion offers an alliance to the Hill Tribes; fight the enemies of [[House Lannister]] in exchange for weapons, gold and autonomy from the [[Eyrie]]. Timett agrees to the alliance and escorts Tyrion to the Lannister encampment in the [[Riverlands]]. They are joined by other clans including [[Chella]] and the [[Black Ears]], the [[Moon Brothers]] and the [[Painted Dogs]]. Timett is presented to [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] by Tyrion.

Normally Burned Men are expected to burn off a finger or nipple as a show of might during their rite of manhood, but Timett burned out an eye as a sign of bravery and might, which earned him great respect within his tribe and the title of Red Hand.  Timett and more of the Burned Men are among the clansmen who follow Tyrion to the Lannister camp, and subsequently participate the [[Battle of the Green Fork]].  In ''A Clash of Kings'', when Tyrion is sent to King's Landing to act as the Hand of the King, Timett is among the clansmen who escort and serve him as bodyguards and enforcers.  [[Varys]] and Bronn report to Tyrion that Timett killed a wine-seller's son at a gambling den; the fool thought that a one-eyed man would be easier to cheat, but Timett caught him, pinned his wrist to the table with a dagger, and ripped out his throat barehanded. Hearing that, Tyrion nonchalantly comments that the honest men of the city owe Timett a debt of gratitude.  In ''A Storm of Swords'', Bronn informs Tyrion that Timett led the Burned Men back to the Vale, with all the plunder they took from Stannis's camp after the fighting.  Timett does not appear in the next novels. He is only listed among the chief clans in the appendices of ''A Feast for Crows'' and ''A Dance with Dragons''.  In ''A Dance with Dragons'', when Tyrion, [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]], and their dwarf companion Penny arrive at the [[Second Sons]]' camp, Tyrion assures Ben Plumm that he can be very generous to his friends; he jokingly mentions Timett (alongside Shagga and Bronn) as a referee.  ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist   [[Category:Hill tribes]] [[Category:Living individuals]] [[Category:Valemen]]   [[de:Timett]] [[es:Timett]] [[fr:Timett]] [[it:Timett]] [[ru:Тиметт]] [[zh:提魅]]
