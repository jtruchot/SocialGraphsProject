We should march on them at once.|Addam Marbrand|Fire and Blood Ser '''Addam Marbrand''' is the heir of Lord [[Damon Marbrand|Damon]] of [[House Marbrand]] and a bannerman of [[House Lannister]].  ==Biography== ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]=== A messenger reports news from Ser Addam's outriders to [[Tywin Lannister]]. Ser Addam's scouts have noticed [[Robb Stark]]'s forces have crossed the [[Neck]] and are moving south along the east bank of the Green Fork of the [[Trident]]."[[The Pointy End]]" Tywin's forces later engage and defeat the Stark force in the [[Battle of the Green Fork]]. The Stark army is much smaller than the scouts reported because they separated at the [[Twins]]."[[Baelor]]"  Ser Addam is present for a strategy meeting with Tywin following the defeat in the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] by the main portion of the Stark army. Also present are [[Tyrion Lannister|Tywin]], [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], [[Leo Lefford]], [[Harys Swyft]] and another [[Lannister bannerman 2|bannerman]], as well as Tywin's servant and several Lannister officers. He asks about [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]], and Kevan confirms that both Baratheon brothers have declared against the Lannisters. Later he dismisses suing for a truce so as to not appear weak, and proposes that they march against the Starks instead. Tywin dismisses his bannermen and then announces plans to relocate to [[Harrenhal]]."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 1 appearances|10=yes  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Addam Marbrand is one of the chief knights in the service of Tywin. He is a rangy man, with long, dark copper hair and wears a smoke grey cape.  During his youth, Addam was a page at [[Casterly Rock]] and a childhood friend of [[Jaime Lannister]].  Similarly to the show, Addam attends the council that Tywin holds after the recent defeats at the [[Battle of the Whispering Wood]] and the [[Battle of the Camps]]. He is against asking for a truce, stating that two battles do not make a war, and volunteers to try his own steel against "[[Robb Stark|that Stark boy]]". Tywin orders his host to [[Harrenhal]], dispatching Addam's outriders to screen their movements.  Ser Addam is one of Tywin's bannermen present at Harrenhal and departs the ruined castle a day before his liege lord. He survives the Battle of the Fords and joins Tywin in the march south when the latter receives word of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s imminent attack. After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Addam is made Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]]. Tyrion considers this a shrewd move on his father's part, as like his brother Jaime, Addam is both a skilled commander and has the charisma to convince men to follow him into battle.  After Jaime returns to King's Landing, he practices with Addam for a while, but fearing that Addam may get drunk and reveal what poor fighter Jaime is now, he moves to practice with [[Ilyn Payne]].  Addam accompanies Jaime in his mission to resolve the siege of Riverrun. He is quite content to leave the City Watch and command the outriders.   ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Marbrand navbox   DEFAULTSORT:Marbrand, Addam [[Category:Bannermen of House Lannister]] [[Category:Individuals of uncertain fate]] [[Category:Knights]] [[Category:Members of House Marbrand|Addam Marbrand]] [[Category:Westermen]]   [[de:Addam Marbrand]] [[es:Addam Marbrand]] [[it:Addam Marbrand]] [[nl:Addam Marbrand]] [[ru:Аддам Марбранд]] [[zh:亚当·马尔布兰]]
