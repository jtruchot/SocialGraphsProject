Donnel is the second of Lady Anya's three sons: Morton, Donnel, and Wallace. He serves at the Bloody Gate and leads the sortie that saves [[Catelyn Stark]] and her retinue from the [[Hill tribes|mountain clans]] at the [[Mountains of the Moon]]. After [[Brynden Tully]] departs with Catelyn, Donnel later replaces him as the new Knight of the Gate.  Later at the Bloody Gate, Anya introduces her grandson Roland, a muscular man about 25 years old, as well as her youngest son Wallace, who is identified as Roland's uncle. It is not clear if Roland is Morton's son or Donnel's son.  ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist   Waynwood navbox   DEFAULTSORT:Waynwood, Donnel [[Category:Knights]] [[Category:Living individuals]] [[Category:Members of House Waynwood|Donnel Waynwood]] [[Category:Servants and retainers of House Arryn]] [[Category:Valemen]]   [[de:Donnel Waynwald]] [[pl:Donnel Waynwood]] [[ru:Доннел Уэйнвуд]]
