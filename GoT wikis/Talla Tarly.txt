He has yellow teeth and...|Talla Tarly to Samwell Tarly|Blood of My Blood Lady '''Talla Tarly''' is the only daughter of late [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Randyll Tarly]] of [[Horn Hill]] and the middle child between [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]] and [[Dickon Tarly]].  ==Biography== ===Background=== Talla was born at Horn Hill to Randyll and [[Melessa Tarly]]. She is the sister of Samwell and Dickon.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]=== Talla's brother Sam is en route to the [[Citadel]] to study about the [[White Walkers]]. Since the Citadel does not accept women and children, he plans to send [[Gilly]] and her baby [[Sam]] to live with his family at Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father Randyll, he gets on with Talla and their mother Melessa."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Talla eagerly greets Sam as he arrives with Gilly and her baby, complaining about her arranged marriage to the old, yellow-toothed [[Symun Fossoway]]. Talla takes Gilly under her wing and starts musing on what color she would look best in. She also offers to put Gilly up in one of her bedrooms. [[File:Blood of my blood House Tarly dinner.jpg|thumb|Talla and her family have dinner with Gilly.]] At dinner, Talla makes small talk with Gilly, and is impressed that Gilly can hunt for herself, as Randyll never saw the need for her to learn. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a wildling, Melessa listens to his rant before giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]=== With the deaths of her father and Dickon in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]],"[[Eastwatch]]" and with Sam unable to inherit as both a man of the [[Night's Watch]] and a [[Order of Maesters|maester]]-in-training, Talla becomes the Lady of Horn Hill and head of House Tarly.  ==Appearance== GoT/Season 6 appearances|6 = yes  ==Family tree== ===Paternal=== House Tarly family tree  ===Maternal=== House Florent family tree  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Talla has been briefly mentioned as Sam's sister but otherwise not described in detail and has not yet appeared. She has not been betrothed to anyone.  Randyll Tarly has five children: his eldest child Samwell, then three daughters, and finally his second son Dickon. After he became dissatisfied with the bookish Samwell as a child, he kept having more children with his wife, until they produced another son to replace him. Talla is the eldest of Samwell's three sisters (the other two haven't been named).   ==See also== *AWOIAF   ==References== Reflist   House Tarly   DEFAULTSORT:Tarly, Talla [[Category:Living individuals]] [[Category:Lords of Horn Hill|Talla Tarly]] [[Category:Members of House Tarly|Talla Tarly]] [[Category:Reachmen]] [[Category:Ruling ladies]]   [[de:Talla Tarly]] [[es:Talla Tarly]] [[fr:Talla Tarly]] [[nl:Talla Tarling]] [[ru:Талла Тарли]] [[zh:塔拉·塔利]]
