You and the pretty [[Jon Snow|crow]] do a lot of talking [[Tormund]], and when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?|The Lord of Bones to [[Tormund]], who responds by beating him to death with his own staff.|Hardhome (episode) The '''Lord of Bones,''' also known as '''Rattleshirt''',[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-3/episode-8/people/110/rattleshirt HBO viewers guide, season 3: episode 8 people, Rattleshirt entry] was a notorious leader among the [[Free Folk]] and a fearsome raider.  ==Biography== ===Background=== The Lord of Bones is an infamous [[Free Folk|wildling]] raider. He is known for wearing a [[Giants|giant]]'s skull instead of a helmet and armor made of bones, which he wears to intimidate his enemies. His real name is unknown.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]=== [[File:Rattleshirt.png|thumb|The Lord of Bones wears the front of a [[Giants|giant]]'s skull as a mask and bones as armor.]]  [[Ygritte]] takes [[Jon Snow]] to the rest of the warparty and introduces him, to the Lord of Bones, as "a present". The wildling commander is dismissive of Ygritte's arguments to keep him alive, as he already has [[Qhorin]] as prisoner. He relents, however, after Ygritte's insistence and the reminder that [[Mance Rayder]] would want to decide for himself whether the [[Bastardy|bastard]] son of [[Eddard Stark]] lives or dies. However, he threatens Ygritte to castrate Jon should he try to escape. As the warband and their prisoners march to Mance Rayder's camp in [[Skirling Pass]], Qhorin attacks Jon, blaming him for the deaths of [[Stonesnake]], [[Borba]] and [[Harker]]. The Lord of Bones warns Qhorin not to strike his captive again."[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"  When Halfhand attacks Jon once again, as part of his plan to have Jon infiltrate Mance Rayder's host, the Lord of Bones orders his men to let the two fight. After Jon kills Qhorin, the Lord of Bones cuts the ropes binding his hands together and orders his men to burn the Halfhand's corpse. He turns to Jon and taunts him that he would not want Qhorin's corpse [[Wight|coming back]] for him."[[Valar Morghulis]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]=== The Lord of Bones successfully brings Jon to the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]'s camp and to Mance Rayder's tent. Removing his helmet, he is commended by Mance and then asked to leave with his group, including Ygritte, so that Mance may speak to Jon in private to which he obliges."[[Valar Dohaeris]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]=== [[File:Lord of Bones Dead (Hardhome).PNG|thumb|The Lord of Bones beaten to death by [[Tormund]].]]  [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] visit Hardhome to rally the wildling forces to fight the undead army. The Lord of Bones meets with Tormund, and speaks about the events which led Jon and Tormund to work together. The Lord of Bones accuses Tormund of being a traitor and makes an insulting remark about Tormund sucking Jon's cock. Before he can finish the insult, Tormund grabs his staff and beats him to death with it in front of the other wildlings.  If his corpse was not burned while the parlay was taking place, it is likely that in the aftermath of the massacre at Hardhome, the Lord of Bones was reanimated as a wight by the [[Night King]] alongside all the other dead Wildlings and brothers of the Night's Watch."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 2 appearances||||||||yes|no|yes GoT/Season 3 appearances|1=yes GoT/Season 5 appearances|8 = yes  ==Gallery==  RattleshirtPromo.png|Promotional image of Rattleshirt.

[[Night's Watch|crow]]!|The Lord of Bones to [[Qhorin]]|The Prince of Winterfell  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Lord of Bones is one of a number of formerly fiercely independent wildling warrior leaders who has been recruited by [[Mance Rayder]], the King-Beyond-the-Wall, to join his forces. He is a fierce enemy of the [[Night's Watch]]. Though he refers to himself as the Lord of Bones, the Night's Watch dubbed him "Rattleshirt" as a mockery of the rattle sound produced by his armor. His true name is unknown.  It is not [[Tormund]] but the Lord of Bones who is captured by the Watch during the [[Battle of Castle Black]]. Tormund never goes to Hardhome and thus never kills him there, as he did in the TV show. Instead, [[Melisandre]] has him burned alive, but switches his appearance with that of Mance Rayder to make it look as if Mance is the one being burned, and Mance masquerades as the Lord of Bones for a while before revealing himself.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist|2   [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Free Folk]] [[Category:Mance Rayder's army]] [[Category:Wights]]   [[de:Herr der Knochen]] [[fr:Seigneur des Os]] [[ru:Костяной Лорд]]
