He has a daughter, [[Palla]]."[[The Old Gods and the New]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]=== [[File:Bran surrenders Winterfell.jpg|thumb|Winterfell gathers to witness Bran surrendering to Theon]] After Winterfell is [[Fall of Winterfell|seized by ironborn raiders]] led by [[Theon Greyjoy]], Farlen is among the members of the [[House Stark|Stark]] household forcibly assembled at the castle's yard to witness Prince [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s official yielding to Theon. Farlen refuses to serve Theon, and insists he's a servant of House Stark. One of the ironborn raiders, [[Drennan]], beats him over the head with a club. He is helped up off the ground by his daughter. They are both present when Theon assembles the people after the escape of Bran and [[Rickon Stark]] and unveils two charred corpses and hangs them up on either side of the castle gates."[[A Man Without Honor]]"  Farlen and his daughter were likely put to sword by Ramsay Bolton's men during the [[Sack of Winterfell]], as they are never to be seen again after Winterfell is [[Battle of the Bastards|retaken]] and House Stark is restored as the ruling house of the North.  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 2 appearances|6=yes|7=yes  ==Quotes== Dialogue a-b-c|Theon Greyjoy|He claims the North as well by right of conquest.

It is not him but [[Mikken]] the blacksmith who talks defiantly to [[Theon Greyjoy]], and is killed for that.  Farlen is falsely accused by Theon of killing three of the [[ironborn]] (who were actually killed by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] at Theon's command), and is beheaded by Theon. In the TV series, he is replaced by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] at the execution scene.  ==See also== *AWOIAF  ==References== Reflist   Stark navbox   [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Kennelmasters]] [[Category:Northmen]] [[Category:Servants and retainers of House Stark]] [[Category:Smallfolk]]   [[de:Farlen]] [[fr:Farlen]] [[ru:Фарлен]] [[zh:法兰]]
