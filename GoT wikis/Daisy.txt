He asks if Ros can hit Daisy and she spanks her gently. Joffrey asks if Tyrion sent them and Ros says that Tyrion chose them himself. Joffrey forces Ros to hit Daisy with his belt, hard enough to make her scream. He hands Ros a stag's head sceptre, and she protests that too much pain will spoil the pleasure.
