He is an immensely wealthy [[Slavery|slaver]] who has grown rich from the training and trading of the [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]=== Greizhen accompanies fellow Good Master [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] and a third Good Master for negotiations with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and is amused by Kraznys' comments about her. When Daenerys states that she wants to buy not just the fully-trained Unsullied but the slaves in training as well, Greizhen opposes, concerned that if these half-trained warriors fail on the battlefield it would shame Astapor."[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"  [[File:KraznysGreizhen.jpg|thumb|Greizhen and Kraznys about to deliver the Unsullied]]  Greizhen is present at one of Astapor's plazas for the conclusion of the transaction with Daenerys: the Unsullied and the half-trained boys in exchange for her [[dragon]], [[Drogon]]. He is killed when Daenerys orders the Unsullied to kill all the Good Masters, slave-drivers, and soldiers in the city, sparing only the children, and to liberate all the slaves."[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"  ==Appearances== GoT/Season 3 appearances|3=yes|4=yes  ==In the books== In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, when Daenerys meets with the Good Masters, one of them, Grazdan mo Ullhor, is hesitant to sell the half-trained Unsullied because, if defeated, Astapor and the Good Masters would be shamed. The name seems to have been changed because Grazdan is a common name in [[Slaver's Bay]].  During the sack of Astapor, Grazdan yells to the Unsullied to defend their masters, but they do not comply. He is killed by [[Rakharo]].  ==See also== *AWOIAF|Grazdan mo Ullhor   ==References== Reflist   DEFAULTSORT:Ullhor, Greizhen mo [[Category:Astapori]] [[Category:Deceased individuals]] [[Category:Good Masters]] [[Category:House of Ullhor|Greizhen mo Ullhor]] [[Category:Slavers]]   [[de:Greizhen mo Ullhor]] [[fr:Greizhen mo Ullhor]] [[ru:Грейзхен мо Уллхор]]
