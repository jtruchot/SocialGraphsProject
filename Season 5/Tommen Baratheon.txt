 5]]=== During the wake of his grandfather, Tommen is approached by Margaery, who shares a few close words with the king and holds his hand briefly. All of this is observed by Cersei from afar."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Claiming to be acting under Tommen's orders, Cersei convenes a meeting of the small council, declaring that Tommen has decided to wait until he's older to appoint his own [[Hand of the King]]. She also invokes Tommen's name in appointing [[Mace Tyrell]] the new Master of Coin as well as the Master of Ships, in promoting [[Qyburn]] to [[Master of Whisperers]], and in offering [[Kevan Lannister]] the new position of Master of War. Kevan calls Cersei out, however, and refuses to serve unless Tommen himself asks him to."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Tommen and Margaery are wed.]] Tommen and Margaery are finally married, to much fanfare. They waste little time in consummating the marriage, although it seems to go rather quickly. Tommen muses that his mother doesn't like King's Landing, and Margaery subtly implies that Cersei will continue acting like a mother lioness around Tommen in spite of the fact that he's reached his majority and is now married.  [[Tommen and Cersei discuss Casterly Rock.]] The following morning, Tommen walks with his mother on the battlements of the Red Keep and suggests that she might go back to Casterly Rock, since she's always described it as home. Cersei denies this, saying that King's Landing is her home. Tommen then asks if she would happier at Casterly Rock, after which Cersei immediately recognises Margaery's hand in manipulating her son. When Cersei later talks to Margaery, she finds the younger queen bragging about Tommen's libido, which she says is to be expected, given that he's both a [[House Lannister|lion]] and a [[House Baratheon|stag]]."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]" However, their relationship soon turns sour, on Margaery's part, after her brother, [[Loras Tyrell]], is arrested by the [[Faith Militant]] for his homosexuality, Tommen is confronted by an angry Margaery, who tells him that Cersei was most likely behind this to separate them.  [[Tommen attempts to have Loras set free.]] Tommen confronts his mother and demands that Loras be released, but she calmly tells him that she did not give the order, but it was the [[High Sparrow]], although Tommen still blames Cersei for giving the High Sparrow an army in the first place. Tommen later goes to the Sept of Baelor to try and speak with the High Sparrow, but the Sparrows block his way, telling the young king that the High Sparrow is at prayer. His Kingsguard offer to fight their way through the crowd to get inside, but Tommen refuses, even when the common folk begin to insult him as a "bastard" and an "abomination." He later regretfully tells his wife that he was unsuccessful."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]" [[Tommen is unable to prevent Queen Margaery's arrest.]] Tommen is present at Loras's tribunal, where [[Olyvar]] provides testimony to his homosexuality, leading to his arrest. Margaery is also arrested for providing false witness during the tribunal. As she is dragged away by the Faith Militant, she pleas for Tommen to intervene. In shock, Tommen decides not to create further conflict, signalling for his Kingsguard not to intervene in her arrest and subsequent incarceration."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Cersei comforts Tommen.]] Later, he voices his frustration and his plans to attack the Sept of Baelor in front of his mother, who manipulates him into letting her handle the situation, citing that Margaery would likely be the first casuality if Tommen should act against the Faith Militant."[[The Gift]]" When this eventually leads to her capture by the Sparrows, however, Tommen loses his appetite and falls into depression, refusing to eat and staying in his chambers, receiving no one. Following his mother's [[walk of atonement]], Tommen becomes increasingly distant from Cersei."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"   ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
