 5]]=== [[Cersei visits the High Sparrow.]] In the aftermath of her [[Tywin Lannister|father's]] [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|murder]], Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] seeks him out and discovers the High Sparrow is a humble man, serving soup and bread to the poor while barefoot. He finds the name "High Sparrow" humorous and makes no effort to hide what action the Sparrows took against the [[High Septon (after the Riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]], though he admits they could have been more careful. Cersei tells him that he will not be arrested or executed, but the High Septon has been imprisoned instead, which surprises the High Sparrow."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"[[The High Sparrow is informed of Loras' homosexuality.]]Through Queen Cersei's influence, the High Sparrow is elected High Septon. To further gain his support, Cersei has Tommen sign a decree restoring the [[Faith Militant]], a military order under the command of the High Septon with the right to bear arms and dispense justice, for the first time since the reign of King [[Maegor Targaryen]]. The Queen Mother even 'dutifully' reveals the presence of a great sinner amongst the royal family to his High Holiness. The High Sparrow later presides over the inquest into the charges of buggery, and blasphemy against Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]. He also questions [[Margaery Tyrell]] and [[Olyvar]] on the grave accusations. Olyvar's testimony convinces the High Septon to bring Loras to full trial, and also to arrest Margaery for perjury and blasphemy, as she swore before the gods that her (false) testimony was true, despite her royal status."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  [[Olenna confronts the High Sparrow in the Great Sept of Baelor.]]Whilst scrubbing the floors of the Great Sept, the High Sparrow is approached by [[Olenna Tyrell]]. After exchanging some barbs and pleasantries the pair discuss Loras and Margaery's arrests. The Queen Of Thorns wants her grandchildren released immediately, but the High Sparrow refuses arguing that the divine laws should apply to both high-and [[Smallfolk|lowborn]], and with none exempt. Olenna resorts to offering him a bribe, and when this fails she threatens to have House Tyrell cease supplying the realm with their crops. Unimpressed, the High Sparrow challenges the Tyrell matriarch, asking if she or anyone in her House has ever performed any labor in the field; those who labored are likely to side with their own than with those who merely watch and oversaw their manual laboring. He adds that the smallfolk are many while the nobility are few, and asks what will happen when the many stop fearing the few. He then leaves her."[[The Gift]]"  Later, the High Sparrow receives Cersei, who has come to the Great Sept to inquire about the imprisonment arrangements of Queen Margaery, at the lowest and oldest level of the Great Sept - a simple stone sept with none of the grand adornments of the Great Sept that [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]] built on top of it. He tells her of the limited known history of the chapel, making plain his love of the simplicity in how it represents pure faith and compares it unfavorably to the grandiosity of the Great Sept. He uses this comparison to show how the highborn, like the Tyrells, can be stripped back to reveal the pure truth beneath their facade and then openly wonders and asks what they will find of Cersei once they strip back her finery to reveal the truth beneath. He then tells her of a highborn young man who has already stripped himself in this fashion, and adds that he had much to say of her. [[Lancel Lannister]] then enters the chapel to stand beside the High Sparrow. They both silently watch as an exceedingly flippant Cersei is arrested by Septas [[Unella]], [[Moelle]], and [[Scolera]].  [[Cersei confesses (some of) her sins.]]Days later The High Sparrow agrees to see the Queen Mother, when Cersei at last acquiesces to confessing her sins. He interrupts Cersei's long speech of wanting to be clean again in order to hear her actual confession. The High Sparrow is relatively pleased that the Queen admits to having committed adultery with Lancel, but states that a trial will be held nonetheless to ascertain the truth behind the other charges she still denies: [[regicide]] and [[incest]]. When Cersei invokes the [[Mother]]'s mercy, the High Sparrow agrees to let her return to the [[Red Keep]] to see Tommen, but only after she has atoned.  [[The High Sparrow watches Cersei's atonement.]] Before the gates of the Great Sept, the High Sparrow addresses the people of [[King's Landing]]. He explains that though the Queen Mother has sinned greatly, she now begs forgiveness and will thus perform a [[walk of atonement]] from the Sept to the Red Keep as the gods made her: completely nude and with her long golden hair cut short"[[Mother's Mercy]]" while Septa Unella follows, ringing a bell and chanting the word "shame!". When the once prideful Cersei walks shakily past him, the High Sparrow can't help but grin ever so slightly.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
