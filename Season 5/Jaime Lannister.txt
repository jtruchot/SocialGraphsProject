 5]]=== [[Cersei chastises Jaime in the Great Sept.]] During the funeral of his father, Tywin Lannister, Jaime meets with Cersei in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Jaime warns his sister that all the power and prestige their father built for House Lannister belongs to them now and that, once everyone sees that Tywin is truly dead, their enemies will do everything they can to take it away from them. Cersei bluntly states that their true enemy is Tyrion and that Jaime is partly responsible for Tywin's death since he was the one who released their father's murderer. He is left alone in the Sept, looking at his father's corpse and feeling guilty."[[The Wars To Come]]" [[Cersei shows Jaime the "gift" from Dorne.]] Jaime is summoned by Cersei, who has received a "gift" from [[Dorne]]: an ornately carved viper, with Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. Both siblings understand the gift as a threat from [[House Martell]]. Even though she is equally to blame for covering up their incest, Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of their children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. Jaime declares that he will bring Myrcella home, but Cersei mockingly asks how a one-handed man can rescue a princess alone. Jaime tells her that he never said he was going alone.  Later, Jaime goes to [[Castle Stokeworth]] in order to recruit Bronn on his mission to return Myrcella to King's Landing. To convince him to go, Jaime reveals that Cersei has arranged for [[Wyllis Bracken]] to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]] instead of Bronn, and offers him a much better girl than Lollys and a much better castle once they return from [[Dorne]]."[[The House of Black and White]]"  During the journey to Dorne, Bronn pushes Jaime for answers as to why he is rescuing Myrcella personally instead of sending an army. Jaime responds that he does not want to start a war, but Bronn insinuates that he knows Myrcella is actually Jaime's daughter and not his niece. He also warns Jaime on the impulsiveness of the Dornish people, and asks if Jaime set Tyrion free. Jaime claims it was Varys. Bronn asks Jaime to give Tyrion his regards should he see him again, but Jaime responds by saying that if he ever sees Tyrion again, he will kill him in revenge for their father.  [[Jaime uses his metal hand to stop a blade.]] Not long after, Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne, where Bronn narrowly saves Jaime from being poisoned by a viper. As they make their way towards Dorne, they are discovered by Dornish soldiers and a fight ensues. Jaime personally duels one of the soldiers and holds his own with his left hand until he is disarmed. The man moves in to kill Jaime, who catches the blade in his metal hand and uses the distraction to get his sword and finish his opponent. Over Bronn's protests, Jaime insists that they bury the soldiers in order to avoid suspicions. Unbeknownst to either, [[Ellaria Sand]] and the [[Sand Snakes]] are aware that Jaime is coming for Myrcella."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  [[Jaime is threatened by the point of Areo Hotah's longaxe.]] Jaime and Bronn, disguised as Dornish soldiers, finally reach the Water Gardens and find Myrcella with [[Trystane Martell]]. Myrcella is understandably surprised to see her alleged uncle in Dorne, but as Jaime attempts to persuade his daughter to flee with him, they are attacked by the Sand Snakes, who plan to kill Myrcella in order to force Prince [[Doran Martell]] into war with the Lannisters to avenge Oberyn Martell's death. Jaime and Bronn [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|fight]] with the Sand Snakes, with Jaime focused on [[Obara Sand]], until Doran's bodyguard, [[Areo Hotah]], appears with a handful of Martell guards and orders them to stand down. Jaime is briefly mocked by Areo for his missing hand before he drops his weapon, and he, Bronn, the Sand Snakes and Ellaria Sand are all arrested."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Myrcella and Jaime talk about Trystane.]] Jaime is locked up in a bedroom-like cell. Areo brings Myrcella to visit him. Jaime tells her that the situation has grown dangerous and he needs to take Myrcella back to King's Landing, though he fails to mention that it is because the Dornishmen seek to use her as a way to gain revenge for Oberyn. She soundly rejects his advice and claims she wants to stay in Dorne and marry Trystane, before leaving him alone."[[The Gift]]" [[Jaime is escorted to meet Doran.]] Later, Jaime is escorted into the main apartments of the Water Gardens by [[Areo Hotah]], to be received by Prince Doran Martell in his solar, along with Ellaria, Trystane and Myrcella. He comments on the nature of Myrcella's clothes, suggesting that they are too revealing, covering this suggestion up by asking if she is cold. She rebuffs this, stating that she is suited to the Dornish climate. Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck into Dorne to abduct Myrcella back to King's Landing.  [[Jaime is received in Prince Doran Martell's solar.]] He says he feared for her safety, but when Doran insists as to why he didn't just send a letter by messenger raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: Myrcella's Lannister lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper. Jaime asks if Doran intends to behead him, but he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war. Doran insists that for the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne to continue, the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand, and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the small council. Jaime finds Doran's request entirely reasonable, and Myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from Trystane, so Jaime agrees."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  Ellaria later visits Jaime in his quarters and pretends to make amends with him, acknowledging that neither he nor Myrcella played any part in Oberyn's death, but expresses her knowledge that Myrcella is not Jaime's niece, but his daughter. Before leaving, she mocks him for not being born centuries ago into the Targaryen family, in which position his incest would have been accepted.   [[Jaime embraces Myrcella as his daughter moments before her unexpected death.]] Jaime, Bronn, Myrcella and Trystane say their farewells to the Martells to return to King's Landing. Upon saying goodbye, Ellaria Sand kisses Myrcella on the lips. Aboard the ship, Myrcella and Jaime talk about Cersei. Jaime begins to come clean to Myrcella, awkwardly telling her that one cannot choose who he/she love. Myrcella then reveals that she knows that Jaime is her real father, and that she is glad that he is, and the two embrace. However, Myrcella's nose starts to bleed and she collapses and dies in Jaime's arms, a victim of poison from Ellaria's kiss."[[Mother's Mercy]]"   ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
