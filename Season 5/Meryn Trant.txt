Meryn brings two men who claim to have Tyrion's head before Cersei but she states that they have killed the wrong dwarf, to Ser Meryn's disgust, so he suggests imprisoning them. However, Cersei pardons the men since imprisoning them might dissuade other hunters."[[The House of Black and White]]"   Ser Meryn accompanies Cersei, who is intent on dispensing with the Tyrell influence on the monarchy, when she visits the [[High Sparrow]]. Although he voices his concern about such a visit, Cersei believes that the [[Sparrows]] are deeply religious and that they are in no danger."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  [[Meryn arrives in Braavos]] When [[Mace Tyrell]] is assigned to negotiate a deal concerning the Crown's debt with the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], Cersei assigns Ser Meryn to escort Mace to [[Braavos]]."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]" When Trant arrives in Braavos, flanked by some Lannister soldiers, he is spotted by [[Arya Stark]], who recognizes him immediately.
