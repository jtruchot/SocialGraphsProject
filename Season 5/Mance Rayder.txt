= [[Jon stresses Mance's surrender.]] In the aftermath of the wildlings' defeat at Castle Black, Mance remains a prisoner of Stannis. Stannis asks Jon to convince Mance to bend the knee and help him in his quest to retake the North from [[Roose Bolton]]. Jon is given until nightfall of that very day to win Mance's support, or Mance will be burned alive. Jon attempts to reason with Mance, but he adamantly refuses to kneel before anyone, and even when confronted with a horrific death by burning, Mance ultimately chooses it over serving Stannis. [[Mance is set to be burned by Melisandre.]] That night, Mance is given one last chance to kneel before Stannis as he is taken to the pyre, but still refuses. [[Melisandre]] denounces Mance as the "King of Lies" and proceeds to burn the pyre upon which he is tied to. As Mance burns, he becomes visibly frightened that he is about to be burned alive as his stoic facade begins to fade. Unable to continue watching, Jon shoots him through the heart with an arrow, ending his suffering."[[The Wars To Come]]"
