 5]]=== [[Olyvar and Loras continue their liaison. ]] Olyvar continues to see Loras on a regular basis, though it's unclear if their arrangement is personal or professional. Around the time of [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s funeral, Olyvar is cuddling with Loras Tyrell post coitus, discussing the possibility of visiting [[Dorne]] or anywhere far away from [[King's Landing]], when [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] walks in. Staring down Olyvar, she admonishes Loras for making them late for supper with King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], and tells Olyvar to leave."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Olyvar later plays the role of the Father with a fake beard when the [[High Septon (after the Riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]] visits the brothel, while a collection of female prostitutes play the rest of the Seven. He breaks character to make a snide remark about the High Septon's choice, and to remind him that two prostitutes will cost him extra. Moments later, the brothel is attacked by [[Sparrows]], led by [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], who seize the High Septon. Olyvar attempts to tell them that they will have to answer to Baelish, but they strike him across the face and remove his fake beard."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  Olyvar is present when the brothel is attacked again by the Sparrows, this time having formed into the [[Faith Militant]] with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s permission. Again, he is struck when he tells them they will have to answer to Baelish. Olyvar hears screams coming from another room which he approaches to see the Sparrows have singled out a man having sex with one of the male prostitutes, and approach him with a knife. Olyvar flees as one of the men screams off-screen."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Olyvar is later called to give evidence at the "Holy Inquest" of Loras, who is accused of "fornication", "buggery", and "blasphemy", though it is clear he is doing it on Cersei's instructions. Despite their previous, affectionate relationship, Olyvar turns on his lover, and provides the High Sparrow with testimony that allows him to pursue formal charges against Loras, who attempts to attack Olyvar but is restrained. Olyvar's testimony also leads to Margaery's arrest for perjury, despite Loras and Margaery both denouncing Olyvar as a liar."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  Later, during a meeting between Lady Olenna and Petyr Baelish, Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him back to King's Landing for "a piece of information" he had, revealing that Cersei forced Baelish to give up Olyvar so she could build up a case against Loras and Margaery. He tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: a handsome young man â€”implied, in this instance, to be Lancel."[[The Gift]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
