= Selyse, alongside her daughter, are present when [[Mance Rayder]] is executed by [[Stannis Baratheon]] for refusing to bend the knee. She expresses joy as [[Melisandre]] speaks of the [[R'hllor|Lord of Light]] and when Mance begins to be consumed by the flames."[[The Wars To Come]]" [[Selyse departs Castle Black.]] Selyse finds her daughter teaching [[Gilly]] letters so that she may learn to read. The queen disapproves of such action, telling Shireen that her father conquered Gilly's "people" and that as a wildling she is still dangerous. Shireen attempts to defend Gilly, but Selyse simply scolds her for being naive, despite all her reading of books."[[The House of Black and White]]" She also prevents Shireen from discussing militia with Davos."[[Kill the Boy]]" [[Selyse begins to waver at her daughter's execution.]] With an excruciating reluctance, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] offers their daughter to [[Melisandre]] to sacrifice her to [[R'hllor]], in order for his prophecy to become true. When the ceremony begins, Selyse at first stands firm her belief that this is the right thing to do. However, as Shireen is tied to the pyre, she begins to squirm and scream, pleading to her mother and father for her life. When the flame is lit and Shireen continues her cry for help, Selyse has a drastic change of heart and begins to implore Stannis to stop the sacrifice. As her implores turn into a beg, Stannis remains unresponsive.  [[180x180px|Selyse hangs herself after Shireen's death.]]When Stannis does not respond to her pleas, Selyse frantically runs toward the sacrificial pyre in a last, desperate attempt to stop the ceremony, but is stopped by equally distraught [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone|Baratheon]] soldiers. As Shireen's screams die away with her, Selyse looks up in horror at her corpse, letting out a scream, while Stannis turns away with tears welling in his eyes - a rare occurrence for someone seemingly emotionless."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" Consumed by grief for allowing her daughter to die, Selyse shortly thereafter hangs herself in a copse of trees near the Baratheon camp. Stannis is shaken when his scouts discover her body, and Melisandre in turn flees the scene."[[Mother's Mercy]]"
