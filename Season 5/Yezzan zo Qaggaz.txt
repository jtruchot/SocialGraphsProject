 5]]=== [[Yezzan buys Jorah and Tyrion at an auction.]] Yezzan is present at an impromptu slave auction of [[Malko]]'s. He purchases [[Jorah Mormont]] for use in the recently reopened fighting pits. When [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] demands to be bought as well, Yezzan is uninterested in Tyrion's claims that he and Jorah are a team. He changes his mind when Tyrion savagely beats the slaver holding his chain, and pays for him, agreeing with Malko's assertion that Tyrion is "funny". When Tyrion suggests that he and Jorah be paid for their labor to avoid the Queen's ire for practicing slavery, Yezzan hits Tyrion and tosses him a single coin, teasing that it should last the rest of his life. Later, at one of the "lower" pits, Yezzan addresses his fighters and announces that those who survive the day will fight at the [[Daznak's Pit|Great Pit of Daznak]]. Yezzan is shocked to see that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] themselves are present and hastily has his gladiators dedicate their kills to them. Yezzan is later knocked down by Jorah, who emerged from the dungeon early in a desperate attempt to reach the queen."[[The Gift]]"  Later, he is still at the pit observing two of his warriors when Jorah returns from Meereen, seeking "employment" from the slaver again as a gladiator fighting in Yezzan's name and even throwing to the slaver a coin as payment. Thinking it over, Yezzan, who has yet to let Jorah's earlier assault of him slide, wonders why he didn't just leave as Jorah was now free to find "saner occupations", Jorah alludes that he'd be better off "with the devil he knows than one he doesn't" and then asks Yezzan to allow him to fight in the pit in front of the queen, and that if he wins, Yezzan will be allowed to sell Jorah."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
