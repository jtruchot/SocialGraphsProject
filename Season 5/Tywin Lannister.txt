 5]]=== [[Tywin's body on view in the Great Sept.]] Tywin is laid within the Great Sept of Baelor, where Jaime and Cersei pay their respects first. Cersei spends most of her time chastising Jaime about allowing Tyrion to murder Tywin by setting him free. She tells Jaime how much their father loved him and how he was always his favorite. Later, Kevan points out to Cersei that the [[Sparrows]] would have never dared come to King's Landing when Tywin was alive. Likewise, Loras Tyrell indicates to Margaery in confidence that, with Tywin dead, no one can make Cersei marry him, effectively dismantling the arranged marriage.  At the Wall, Stannis Baratheon tells [[Jon Snow]] that this is the time to take back the North from the [[House Bolton|Boltons]], as Tywin can't protect them anymore."[[The Wars To Come]]" Indeed, Roose Bolton later tells his son Ramsay that with Tywin gone, their protection from a potential Northern rebellion is no longer guaranteed since the surviving Lannisters will not likely send their army so far North solely to aid the despised Boltons."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
