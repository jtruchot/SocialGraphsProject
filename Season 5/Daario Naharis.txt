 5]]=== [[Daario listens to Hizdahr's proposition.]] Daario, along with the Second Sons and Hizdahr zo Loraq, returns from their successful mission in Yunkai and is present within in the Great Pyramid when Hizdahr suggests to Daenerys that she should reopen the [[fighting pit|fighting pits]]. Daario notices Daenerys initial fustration with Hizdahr, brandishing his knife while he speaks, amusing Daenerys. Unexpectedly, Daenerys refuses to reopen the fighting pits, even in retrospect of the prospect of freedmen competing rather than slaves. [[Daario tells Daenerys about his upbringing as a pit fighter.]] However, he later explains that he agrees with Hizdahr's suggestion to reopen the pits. He then goes on to tell her about his life growing up as a boy who became a pit fighter himself, and how fighting in the pits made him the warrior he is today. He says he is the only one who will give her honest council. He also explains that a "dragon queen" is no queen without her dragons, which encourages her to visit [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]], who are chained in the catacombs.  [[Daario and Grey Worm search for the Son of the Harpy.]] Daario leads [[Grey Worm]] to a house where the alleged murderer of [[White Rat]] is hiding. He tells Grey Worm that his Second Sons overhear things that the Unsullied do not because they blend in with the local population. Daario is also able to deduce where a [[Son of the Harpy|member]] of the [[Sons of the Harpy]] was hiding because he also understands fear, while the Unsullied do not. Later, he informs the Daenerys' council that the man they arrested has very little useful information since Daario had questioned him earlier. When [[Mossador]] murders the Son of the Harpy, Daenerys has Daario behead Mossador in public, causing a riot."[[The House of Black and White]]"  Daario brings Daenerys the news that Hizdahr zo Loraq, as well as many more supplicants, are waiting for her. He states that it isn't necessary for [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan]] to be present at Daenerys's side when she talks with Hizdahr, claiming that he is very much capable of protecting Daenerys against Hizdahr himself, which leads to Ser Barristan taking a walk in the streets instead and being subsequently murdered by the Sons of the Harpy. He is present when Hizdahr yet again tries to convince Daenerys that the fighting pits should be reopened."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Daario and Daenerys wake over the dead body of Ser Barristan. Hizdahr then enters to offer his condolences. Daario suggests to Daenerys that they could pull back to the pyramid district where they can set up a base of operation so that they can efficiently start working on catching the Sons of the Harpy. Daenerys chose to rather go with Daario's other suggestion, which involves apprehending the leaders of all the great families in Meereen and bringing them to her. Hizdahr states in shock that he is the leader of his family. Daario nods to the guards who then arrest Hizdahr.   [[Daario accompanies Daenerys in the catacombs.]] Daario is present alongside Daenerys in the catacombs when Daenerys threatens Hizdahr and the other apprehended leaders with the use of her dragons, [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]]. Daario pushes [[Great Master 1 (Kill the Boy)|one of the leaders]] before the dragons and watches as the master is burned alive then eaten. Later, while Daenerys is talking to [[Missandei]], she mentions that Daario thinks she should execute all the [[Great Masters]].  [[Daario and Daenerys discuss love and marriage.]] Daario is in bed with Daenerys, asking her if Hizdahr will soon take his place beside her in her bed. Daenerys notes a hint of jealousy in Daario, which she finds amusing and sweet. Daario suggests that on the opening day of the games in the fighting pits, she should apprehend all the Great Masters, [[Wise Masters]] and all other masters of note and execute them. Daenerys responds in horror of this suggestion that she is a queen and not a butcher, to which Daario replies that "''All rulers are either butchers or meat''.""[[The Gift]]"  Daario, along with Daenerys, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], Missandei and Hizdahr are in the [[Daznak's Pit|Great Pit of Daznak]] observing the opening match which is set to take place. The match features two fighters: one large man versus one smaller man. Daario states to Daenerys that she should gamble on the smaller man because Daario thinks that speed defeats size in combat. Daario is referring to himself when he says this, because when he was a pit fighter himself he was also small, but this never stopped him from winning the fights, even when he was fighting against men that were much larger than him.   [[Daario displays his skills with his dagger, nerving Hizdahr.]] Daario goes on explaining why this is so whilst twirling his dagger around Hizdahr's head, which makes Hizdahr nervous. Hizdahr disagrees with Daario's opinion on this matter, saying that in his experience watching the games in the fighting pits the larger men win over the smaller men almost every time. Daenerys responds to Hizdahr by saying that he may not be the right man to speak considering Hizdahr has never fought himself. The fight eventually ends with the larger man winning, just as Hizdahr had predicted, which leaves Daario with a sour look on his face.  Daario, along with the others, is shocked when Jorah shows up as a fighter when the second match is about to commence. Daenerys allows Jorah to fight in the match, and even though Jorah is outmatched for most of the fight he does end up winning the fight in the end. Just after the match has ended, Jorah throws a spear towards the podium where Daenerys is sitting, Daario makes sure the spear doesn't hit Daenerys by pulling her to the side. The spear that Jorah threw was revealed to be targeted towards a member of the Sons of the Harpy who had been sneaking up on Daenerys from behind. Daario looks into the audience to realize that the Sons of the Harpy are there. Daario manages to fight off and kill many of the Sons that were trying to get to Daenerys. Daario witnesses Hizdahr being stabbed repeatedly in the chest as they are trying to escape from the podium, revealing that Hizdahr wasn't in league with the Sons of the Harpy after all as Daario had predicted.   [[Daario fights the Sons of the Harpy during an ambush.]] Daario, Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei, Jorah and a handful of Unsullied all run towards the center of the arena trying to find a way to escape – instead finding themselves surrounded by a huge number of Sons of the Harpy. Daario, Jorah and the Unsullied manage to kill several of them before they eventually realize that they stand no chance against such a huge number of Sons of the Harpy. Just as hope seems to fade away, [[Drogon]] appears in the arena scaring off most of the Sons and killing the rest. Daenerys ends up mounting Drogon on the back and flying out of the arena. Daario, Tyrion, Missandei and Jorah all look up to the sky as Daenerys flies away on Drogon."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[Daario, Jorah, Missandei, Grey Worm and Tyrion debate over the missing Daenerys.]] Daario later strategizes – or rather argues – with Tyrion and Jorah in Daenerys's throne room. When Missandei arrives with Grey Worm, Daario throws a few barbs his way before firmly declaring that neither Tyrion – who has no tracking or combat skills – nor Grey Worm – who is still recovering – can come with them to track the queen down. Instead, Daario declares, Grey Worm and Missandei must lead the Unsullied in keeping the peace, while Tyrion makes sure the city's politics don't bring the pyramids crashing down around them. Daario and Jorah then depart on horseback to find Daenerys."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
