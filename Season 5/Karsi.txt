 5]]=== When [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] arrive at [[Hardhome]] to offer the Free Folk to retreat to [[Castle Black]] and settle [[Gift|south]] of the [[Wall]], a meeting of the clan chieftains is held, where Karsi represents her clan. The Lord Commander appeals to their shared purpose against the [[White Walkers]] and offers them a cache of [[dragonglass]] as a weapon against the [[White Walkers]]. [[Magnar]] [[Loboda]] dismisses this as just as unlikely as the mythical ''"[[ice spider]]s as big as hounds"''. Karsi asks how, with everything they have seen, Loboda can still call this unbelievable. She decides to side with the Lord Commander's plan as long as Tormund vouches for him, but Loboda remains stubborn. He claims that all the Free Folk who get on the Crows' boats will be executed, as they have always been enemies. When he says his ancestors would spit on him if he broke bread with a crow, Karsi retorts that her ancestors would too, but since they are all dead, it doesn't matter. Nevertheless, Loboda abandons the hall and is followed by many other chieftains. As Jon, Tormund, and Karsi stand in dismay, she mutters, ''"I fucking hate Thenns!"''  When Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] arrive to retrieve the wildlings to escape the imminent invasion of the [[White Walkers]], Karsi initially is hostile towards Jon, but after listening to him and Tormund, she agrees to their plan and begins boarding her people into longboats. [[Karsi rises as a wight.]] They begin boarding the wildlings into the longboats, and Karsi puts her daughters in one of them, telling her [[Willa (Hardhome)|youngest]] that her older sister [[Johnna]] is in charge until she comes back. The girl protests, but Karsi says she needs to be there to get the old people on the boats, and promises to be just behind them. Then, the [[White Walkers]] attack with their [[Wight|Army of the Dead]], and Karsi joins the defense of Hardhome while buying time for the rest of the Free Folk to board the boats bound for Castle Black. During the [[Massacre at Hardhome]], Karsi manages to kill several wights while defending the remnants of the Free Folk. Jon Snow tries to convince her to board the boats, but Karsi argues he should go instead, as she doesn't believe the Night's Watch men at Castle Black will let her daughters and the rest of the wildlings through the Wall if Jon Snow is not there. During the fighting, Karsi is confronted by child wights and freezes in shock. Unable to bring herself to kill children, she is overwhelmed. A moment later, she becomes part of their army raised by the [[Night King]]."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
