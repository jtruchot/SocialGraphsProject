= Malko's ship anchors on the shoreline while on a voyage to Volantis so that the slavers can replenish their water supply. The slavers, led by Malko, discover [[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]] and capture them. Malko plans on using Jorah as a galley slave and orders Tyrion to be killed and his penis cut off, as dwarfs' penises are believed to be magic. Tyrion warns Malko that no merchant will believe him unless he sees the source of the penis. Then he attempts to convince Malko to take them to Meereen to the fighting pits where Jorah can prove his worth. After hearing Jorah killed [[Qotho]], a [[Dothraki]] [[bloodrider]], Malko becomes impressed and agrees to take them to Meereen."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  Once he has arrived in Slaver's Bay, Malko proceeds to auction off Jorah while changing details to make his story sound more impressive (and to get a higher price), including Jorah killing ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] (instead of Qotho) and taking part in the [[Siege of Pyke|attack on "Spike"]] while wielding a flaming sword (instead of [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]]). He manages to sell Jorah to [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], a Meereenese [[Great Masters|Great Master]] for 20 gold honors. As Yezzan leads Jorah away, Tyrion desperately attempts to also be sold to Yezzan. Malko scoffs at this, saying that at least Tyrion is funny. Tyrion proceeds to gain control of his chain and beat the slaver who was holding him. Yezzan, intrigued with Tyrion, ends up buying him for a single gold honor because he's funny."[[The Gift]]"
