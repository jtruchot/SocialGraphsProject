= [[Hizdahr pleads Daenerys to reopen the Fighting Pits. ]]Hizdahr and Daario return to Meereen to find the [[Unsullied]] patrolling the streets in response to attacks by the [[Sons of the Harpy]]. Hizdahr is initially happy to report that the [[Wise Masters]] have agreed to have Yunkai governed by a council of freed slaves and former Masters. They have even agreed to submit their important decisions to Daenerys for authorization. However, they insist that the city's infamous [[Fighting pit|fighting pits]] be reopened. Daenerys is furious at this concession and refuses, even though the Wise Masters have agreed that all fighters will be free men who enter the arena willingly. Hizdahr is frustrated when Daenerys ends the argument by declaring that she is a queen, not a politician."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Hizdahr later becomes a member of Daenerys's [[Small council#Under Daenerys Targaryen|small council]], representing the former Great Masters. After [[White Rat]]'s killer is caught, he and Mossador butt heads over what to do with him. Hizdahr disagrees with Mossador's insistence that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the Great Masters. [[Mossador]] ultimately kills the murderer without Daenerys's consent, and Hizdahr witnesses his execution, voicing his opinion that Daenerys should have killed Mossador inside the pyramid with few witnesses instead of publicly executing him."[[The House of Black and White]]"   On the day that usually marks the traditional opening of the fighting season Hizdahr again entreats Daenerys to reopen the fighting pits, noted that while it is not a perfect solution, it will at least be enough to bring the Meereenese and Yunkish Masters to the table."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Following the skirmish that claimed the life of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], Hizdahr visits Daenerys to offer his condolences. He and Daario offer advice on how to deal with the Sons of the Harpy, but Daenerys coolly informs them that she will take the heads of Meereen's great houses into custody. When Hizdahr points out that this description applies to him, the Unsullied grab him immediately.  [[Daenerys intimidates Hizdahr.]] Hizdahr and the other heads of house are brought into the catacombs. As the Unsullied drive them forward, Daenerys explains that she has no idea which of them are guilty and which are innocent (including Hizdahr). When [[Rhaegal]] appears and roasts one of the Great Masters alive, Hizdahr is the only one of the remaining Masters to remain standing, offering as his defense a halfhearted ''"valar morghulis"''. Daenerys, having reminded the Great Masters of what she (and her dragons) can do, allows them to leave with their lives, but keeps them under arrest.   Later, she visits Hizdahr in his cell. His composure now gone, he prostrates himself before her and begs for mercy, his public calm replaced with terror. Daenerys is pleased that he's now being honest again, and informs him that in the interests of peace she will reopen the Fighting Pits (to free men only). She will also show her respect for Meereen by marrying a member of one of its great families â€“ and fortuitously, she already has one of them on their knees before her."[[Kill the Boy]]"  The Sons of the Harpy attacks cease following the betrothal, which brings Daario to believe that Hizdahr may be involved with them, though Daenerys remains unconvinced. Hizdahr and Daenerys visit a fighting pit in order to honor the lesser pit fighters with their presence. Though Daenerys soon desires to leave when she is disturbed by the violence, Hizdahr persuades her to stay in order to respect traditions. He witnesses Jorah Mormont and [[Tyrion Lannister]] reveal themselves to Daenerys in the pit."[[The Gift]]"  [[Hizdahr is brutally stabbed by the Sons of the Harpy.]]  During the Great Games, Hizdahr is lightly intimidated by Daario, who is obviously jealous of his betrothal to Daenerys, though Hizdahr wins a bet against him over a possible surviving fighter. His beliefs in the traditions of the fighting pits are belittled by both Daenerys and Tyrion, the latter musing that [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] would have liked Hizdahr. When the Sons of the Harpy attack [[Daznak's Pit]], Hizdahr attempts to lead Daenerys to safety, but is grabbed and stabbed repeatedly in the chest by four members of the Sons of the Harpy, implying that he had been loyal to Daenerys after all and Daario's theory of him being involved with the Sons of the Harpy was in fact, false.   He lives long enough to witness Daenerys being taken to safety by Jorah, eventually leaving Meereen atop [[Drogon]]."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"
