 5]]=== In the Riverlands, commanding Lannister armies in Tywin's absence, following [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|Tywin's murder]], Kevan returns to King's Landing for his brother's [[funeral]]. His son [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] also appears at the funeral, having finally recovered from the wounds he took at the Battle of the Blackwater. Kevan apologizes to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] for the appearance of his son, who has joined a fanatical religious group known as the [[Sparrows]]. Kevan believes that religion has its place, but he dismisses them as "bloody fanatics" and states that they never would have set foot in the capital while Tywin was alive."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Kevan sits on the [[small council]] when Cersei announces that she will be presiding over the body until the King chooses a new [[Hand of the King]]. After appointing Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] as the new [[Master of Coin]], Qyburn as the new [[Master of Whisperers]] and dismissing [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]]'s and Mace Tyrell's request to be appointed acting Hand, Cersei offers Kevan the new position of [[Master of War]], in his capacity as leader of the Lannister armies in the wake of Tywin's death. Kevan demands to hear the news of his appointment from King Tommen himself but Cersei says that she is speaking in his name for the time being and that he is learning what it means to be a ruler from Cersei.  Angered by her blatant seizure of power to her son's detriment and by her addition of sycophants such as [[Qyburn]] to the small council, Kevan refuses to recognize her authority and informs her that, in his eyes, she is the Queen Mother, nothing more. As he stands to leave, Cersei angrily berates him for abandoning the King in his time of need. Kevan tells her that, should the King ask for him, he would be waiting for him at [[Casterly Rock]] before leaving the small council chamber."[[The House of Black and White]]"  Following Cersei's arrest by the [[High Sparrow]], Grand Maester Pycelle sends a raven to Casterly Rock to summon Kevan back to King's Landing to serve as the Hand of the King. Kevan now presides over the small council. When Cersei asks Qyburn to ask Kevan to come to see her in her cell, Qyburn says he already asked and Kevan refused."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  Kevan is present alongside Pycelle when Cersei returns to the [[Red Keep]] after her walk of atonement. Kevan remains stern and silent as Qyburn fawns over Cersei, presumably having not yet forgiven her for disgracing his son Lancel."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
