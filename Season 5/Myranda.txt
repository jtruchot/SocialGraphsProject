 5]]=== Myranda accompanies the rest of House Bolton to their new home, [[Winterfell]]. She is present when the Boltons and their household gather at the castle's main yard to greet the newly arrived [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]. She watches with obvious jealousy and anger as Ramsay greets his new betrothed, Sansa."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]" While in Ramsay's bedroom, Myranda discusses Ramsay’s upcoming marriage to Sansa, admitting her jealousy of her, especially since Ramsay had promised to marry Myranda back when he was a bastard.   Ramsay disregards Myranda's insecurities, causing Myranda to proclaim that perhaps she will marry too and leave him. This angers Ramsay who violently tells her that she is his and she is not going anywhere unless she continues to bore him with her petty jealousy. He threateningly reminds her what he does to people who bore him, and hearing this Myranda swears never to bore him again. He forces himself on her and she bites his lip before they have sex. [[Myranda introduces herself to Sansa.]] Later, as Sansa wanders around the castle, Myranda approaches her beside the tower where [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] once pushed [[Bran Stark|Bran]] from the window. Myranda puts on a friendly façade, talking to Sansa about her mother’s demise and offering her condolences, which Sansa accepts, though she clearly sees through her. To help Sansa "remember" how things used to be before her family's untimely death, Myranda leads Sansa down to the kennels to reunite her with Theon."[[Kill the Boy]]"  The night of the wedding, Myranda is sent by Ramsay to draw Sansa's bath, an order neither woman is enthusiastic about. As she wrings the black dye out of Sansa's hair, Myranda advises her not to let Ramsay get bored of her, and tells her the fates of Violet, Tansy, and a third girl named [[Kyra]]. Sansa boldly asks if Myranda ever really believed that Ramsay would marry her, which stops the girl dead in her tracks. Sansa coolly declares that she is a Stark and Winterfell is her home: she refuses to be scared and nothing Myranda says will intimidate her. Silently fuming but unable to retaliate, Myranda asks if she is still needed. Sansa dismisses her. She is later present at Ramsay and Sansa's wedding, again looking on with jealousy as they are married."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Myranda lies dead after being thrown from a rampart by Theon.]] During the battle between the Bolton soldiers and the forces of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], Myranda takes Theon and corners Sansa with a bow and arrow, before she can escape, under the orders of Ramsay to bring her to her bed chamber. After Sansa makes it clear that she is unafraid of death, Myranda admits that Ramsay needs Sansa alive in order to birth an heir to the North, though she still threatens to maim her with her arrow. Before she can release it, Theon grabs her, making her fire and miss. In the ensuing struggle, Theon ignores Myranda's pleas and throws her off the rampart to her death, enacting a small justice for the death of Tansy."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
