 5]]=== [[Trystane flirts with Myrcella in the Water Gardens.]] Trystane walks and flirts with his betrothed Myrcella in the [[Water Gardens]] during the argument between [[Ellaria Sand]] and Prince [[Doran Martell]], unaware of the danger their union creates."[[The House of Black and White]]" When [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Bronn]] enter the Water Gardens, Trystane is again taking a walk with Myrcella, with Trystane suggesting they should ask Doran to have them married the next day. Myrcella asks if he only wants to marry her because they are both from Great Houses, but Trystane cuts her off with a passionate kiss. Doran, observing the happy couple, muses to [[Areo Hotah]] that they don't realize how much danger they are in and that they must be protected. [[Trystane and Myrcella declare their love for each other.]] While kissing Myrcella, Trystane encounters Bronn and Jaime in the Gardens. Although he introduces himself courteously enough, he is clearly suspicious, having heard no news of Jaime's visit to Dorne; his suspicions are aroused further when he sees bloodstains on the stolen robes Jaime and Bronn are wearing. Although Bronn cautions him not to do something stupid, Trystane reaches for his sword, forcing Bronn to knock him out, to Myrcella's distress. Jaime then attempts to take Myrcella out of the palace, but he and Bronn are then attacked by Trystane's cousins, the [[Sand Snakes]]. The skirmish ends when all five of the intruders are arrested by Areo Hotah and his guards. [[Trystane is arranged to travel to King's Landing with Myrcella, in order to maintain the Lannister-Martell alliance.]] Doran invites Trystane, Myrcella, Ellaria, and Jaime to drinking and eat with him. There, he promises Jaime that he does not want a war with the Lannisters and that he will send Myrcella back to [[King's Landing]]. However, Trystane and Myrcella's betrothal is to stand, which means Trystane will accompany his betrothed to the capital. He will also take up [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]]'s vacant seat on the [[small council]], to further cement the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne. Jaime accepts these terms. Jaime then brings up the matter of Bronn, who is still imprisoned as a result of his aggression on the prince. Doran defers to Trystane to decide, as he must learn how to punish lawbreakers if he must one day rule. Trystane agrees to let Bronn go on one condition: he will receive the same thing that he inflicted upon him. This meets with his father's approval and Bronn is brought before them and Areo elbows him hard across the face. Trystane later accompanies Jaime, Myrcella and Bronn to the harbor of Sunspear, where he remains silent, as the others say farewell to Prince Doran and Ellaria. However, Trystane's life is put in danger when Ellaria and the Sand Snakes secretly poison Myrcella. "[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
