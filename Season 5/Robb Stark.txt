 5]]=== Despite the fact that he had previously participated in a blood ritual out of hope that it would lead to Robb's death, Stannis remains disgusted at the manner of Robb's demise and offers to avenge him by killing Roose Bolton in an attempt to sway Jon to his side."[[The Wars To Come]]" Later, when Jon is signing request letters to various Houses for new recruits as the newly elected [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]], he balks at sending one to Roose Bolton, reminding [[Samwell Tarly]] that Roose murdered his brother Robb. Though Sam is aware of that and apologizes for presenting Jon with such an unsavory task, he reminds him that the Watch is in dire need of men and supplies, and they cannot get them without help from the Warden of the North. With disgust, Jon reluctantly signs the letter to the Boltons."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Meanwhile, Sansa is brought to Winterfell by [[Petyr Baelish]] in order to be wed. Initially thinking she was to be married to Roose Bolton, Sansa is mortified at the idea of having to marry the man who murdered her brother. Although Petyr corrected her by informing her that she was to be wed to his son, [[Ramsay Bolton]], this did not make Sansa any less displeased about this betrothal. However, she eventually agreed to go along with it under the pretense that Winterfell was her home, and that she would be in a position to avenge her family. When Sansa finally arrives in Winterfell and is greeted by the Boltons, she greets her brother's killer with polite courtesy - although not without hesitation, given her obvious hatred of Roose.""[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"[[File:Theon 5x06.jpg|Theon Greyjoy - clad in a tunic identical to the one Robb died in, as he watches Ramsay rape Sansa.|thumb]]  On the night that Sansa and Ramsay wed, Theon is forced to give the bride away and watch as Ramsay proceeds to forcibly consummate their marriage. While all of this is happening, Theon wears a tunic identical to the one that Robb wore at the [[Red Wedding]]. Whether or not this was intended by the Boltons to further mock Robb's death is unclear."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]] Over the next few days, Ramsay continues to force himself on Sansa, who turns to Theon for help only to discover later on that he informed Ramsay of her escape plan. She demands an answer for his latest betrayal and coldly expresses approval when he tells her about the horrific tortures Ramsay put him through. Theon shamefully admits he deserves to be "Reek" and lists the many terrible things he did, the first of which was betraying Robb."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]" Eventually, however, Theon begins to atone for his role in Robb's downfall by killing [[Myranda]] just as she is about to maim Sansa with an arrow, and by helping Sansa escape Winterfell by jumping off the parapet with her."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
