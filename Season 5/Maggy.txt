 5]]=== When she was a teenager, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] went to visit Maggy at her hut in the woods, accompanied by [[Melara Hetherspoon]], because she had heard that the witch could read people's futures. Cersei entered Maggy's hut uninvited, but when Maggy woke and demanded that she get out, Cersei arrogantly pointed out that Maggy was on [[Tywin Lannister|her father]]'s lands, and threatened that she would have her eyes gouged out if she refused her. Chuckling, Maggy relented and asked Cersei for a taste of her blood, handing her a knife to cut her finger with. Cersei complied and Maggy then literally sucked some blood from the cut, as part of her [[blood magic]]. Maggy told Cersei that she could ask three questions, but mocked the prideful young girl that she wouldn't like the answers.  First, Cersei's father had promised that she would wed [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], and she wanted to know when they would marry. Maggy responded that she wouldn't marry "the prince" but she would marry "[[Robert Baratheon|the king]]". Worried, Cersei used her second question to ask if she would indeed be queen some day. Maggy confirmed that she would, but that in time she would be overthrown by another, [[Daenerys Targaryen|younger and more beautiful queen]], who would cast her down and [[Battle of King's Landing|take all she held dear]]. Third, Cersei asked if she and the king would have children. Maggy cryptically replied that the king would have [[Bastardy|20 children]], but Cersei would have only three. Cersei didn't think that made sense (not realizing that a king can have bastard children), but Maggy continued to say of her three children that gold would be their crowns, and gold their burial shrouds, implying that all of Cersei's children would predecease her.  Cersei remembers meeting Maggy right before her father's funeral, after he was murdered by her own brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. Cersei is disturbed because [[Joffrey Baratheon|her eldest son]] has already died, [[Purple Wedding|poisoned at his own wedding]] to [[Margaery Tyrell]], who will now marry her [[Tommen Baratheon|younger son]] and become the new queen, while her daughter [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] is in [[Dorne]] as a [[ward]]—and potential [[hostage]]—of [[Doran Martell]], brother of the late [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and [[Oberyn Martell]], both of whom died at the hands of her bannerman [[Gregor Clegane]]. Cersei fears that Margaery is the younger and more beautiful queen that Maggy warned her about."[[The Wars To Come]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
