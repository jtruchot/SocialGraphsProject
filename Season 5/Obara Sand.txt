 5]]=== [[Obara reveals the merchant captain: providing information of Jaime's presence in Dorne - and his threat to their coup.]] When [[Ellaria Sand]] goes to the [[Water Gardens]] to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|murder]], she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and points out that the [[Sand Snakes]], who have the love of [[Dornishmen|their people]], agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not."[[The House of Black and White]]"  Ellaria later meets with Obara and Obara's two younger half-sisters, [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] and [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]]. Obara reveals that she captured the merchant captain who smuggled [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Bronn]] into Dorne, and the Sand Snakes and Ellaria deduce Jaime is coming for Myrcella, robbing them of their chance for revenge. Ellaria tells the sisters they must either choose Doran's way and peace, or her way and war. After Tyene and Nymeria agree to side with Ellaria, Obara makes her point by recounting how her father came to claim her, though her mother protested that she was too young and a girl. Oberyn tossed his spear at Obara's feet and said: ''"girl or boy, we fight our battles, but the gods let us choose our weapons."'' He pointed to the spear and then to her mother's tears, and Obara picked up the spear. Then, Obara kills their captive, saying she made her decision a long time ago."[[Sons of the Harpy]]" [[Obara attempts to kidnap Myrcella.]] When the Sand Snakes make their attempt to kidnap Myrcella, Obara leads the [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|attack]], going after Jaime Lannister herself while her sisters battle Bronn. Having her father's skill with a spear, Obara is able to easily force Jaime back, allowing Nymeria to seize Myrcella without interference. However, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. Obara angrily challenges Areo by saying she fights for Dorne, asking who he fights for; Areo simply repeats his command that she drop her weapon. After a tense pause, Obara nods to her sisters and they do so. They, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria Sand, are taken into custody."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  The Sand Snakes end up sharing a prison cell next to Bronn, which proves irritating to Obara and Nym as Bronn continues to sing "[[The Dornishman's Wife]]". When Bronn mentions that he can't hurt a woman because of his "code", Obara sarcastically remarks that she and her sisters have beaten a lot of men with the same code. When Tyene begins flirting with Bronn, Obara looks bored until he begins succumbing to his poisoned wound; she and Nym watch with amusement as Tyene toys with Bronn's life before finally giving him the antidote to the [[long farewell]], a poison which takes its effects depending on the victim's constitution."[[The Gift]]" [[Obara watches as Ellaria concedes defeat.]] Later, Tyene and Nym spar in the cell while Obara tries to ignore them and get some sleep, calling Tyene a slut when she teases Bronn. She and her sisters later witness Ellaria's swearing of fealty to their uncle Doran Martell."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" As a show of peace, Obara, her sisters, and Ellaria gather on the docks to see Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane off; Obara is dressed in robes that are remarkably similar to her father's. When the [[Long farewell|poison]] Ellaria [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|used]] on Myrcella begins to affect her as well, Ellaria quaffs the antidote, while Obara seems pleased."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
