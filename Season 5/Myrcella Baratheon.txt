 5]]=== [[Myrcella with Trystane in the Water Gardens.]] Myrcella walks through the [[Water Gardens]] with her betrothed [[Trystane Martell]], whom she has fallen in love with, while being watched by [[Ellaria Sand]] and Prince [[Doran Martell]]. Ellaria, still furious about Oberyn's death, offers to torture and mutilate Myrcella, and send pieces of her back to take revenge on Cersei, whom she deems responsible for orchestrating Tyrion's show trial which led to the trial by combat that claimed Oberyn's life, but Doran staunchly refuses to harm the girl."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Trystane and Myrcella declare their love for each other.]] As Myrcella and Trystane are wandering the Water Gardens, Myrcella questions Trystane as to if he truly loves her or is only indifferent towards their arranged pairing. Trystane affirms that he has true affections for her. They are once again observed by Prince Doran, who muses to his guard [[Areo Hotah]] that a Lannister and Martell pairing is indeed very dangerous. Myrcella is surprised to see her "uncle" Jaime Lannister after he and Bronn finally locate her as she is kissing Trystane in the gardens. She is upset after Bronn is forced to knock her betrothed unconscious, and struggles against Jaime's advances to leave with him.  The Sand Snakes, on Ellaria's orders, make a sudden ambush in order to kidnap Myrcella. She is nearly taken hostage by [[Nymeria Sand]], but the conflict is mediated after Areo Hotah arrives with a dozen Dornish guards, imprisoning Jaime, Bronn, the Sand Snakes and Ellaria."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[180x180px|Myrcella visits an incarcerated Jaime.]] Myrcella visits Jaime in custody. Jaime tells her that the situation has grown dangerous and he needs to take her home, back to King's Landing, apologising, clearly understanding Myrcella's confusion at his hostiliy towards Dorne. Myrcella, failing to understand after almost being kidnapped by the same girls she believed were her friends, states that Dorne is her home now, and she will stay and marry Trystane before leaving Jaime alone."[[The Gift]]" [[Myrcella watches as negotiations between Jaime and Doran unfold.]] Myrcella is then seen seated next to Trystane at the meeting between the Martells and Jaime. When her 'uncle' remarks that she must be cold in her dress, implying he doesn't approve of the more revealing style of Dornish clothing, Myrcella coolly replies that she is not and that the warmer climate agrees with her, thereby upholding and reasserting her commitment to Dorne and her new life and also demonstrating how much she has flourished there. When Jaime states that her brother Tommen wishes her to return to King's Landing, she is both nonplussed and bothered, but she is palliated when Doran calls for her engagement to his son to continue and that the prince joins her back to the capital, a request Jaime agrees to.  When Ellaria later visits Jaime she reveals that she knows Myrcella is his daughter, born of incest with Cersei. Ellaria admits that she is aware of Myrcella's innocence and that she is not affiliated with Oberyn's murder in an apologetic manner, though Jaime is not entirely convinced."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[Myrcella collapses and dies in her father's arms.]]At the harbor, Myrcella says her farewells to Prince Doran and Ellaria before departing for King's Landing. Ellaria, taking her vengeance, kisses her after coating a [[Long farewell|fatal poison]] on her lips, thus sealing the young girl's fate. On board the boat, Myrcella reveals to Jaime that she has always known of his and Cersei's incestuous relationship and that he is her true father. The two of them share a tender moment before the effects of the poison become apparent. Jaime holds Myrcella as she falls, blood running from her nose."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
