 5]]=== At [[Castle Black]], Sam attempts to comfort [[Gilly]] since she is worried of being sent away by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], which would most likely happen if Alliser is elected as the new [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. Sam reaffirms his promise that where ever Gilly and her baby go, he will go too in order to protect her. Later, Sam is present when [[Mance Rayder]] is executed by [[Stannis Baratheon]] for refusing to bend the knee, and comforts Gilly, who cries in his shoulder."[[The Wars To Come]]"  Sam is reading a book on previous Lord Commanders while Princess [[Shireen Baratheon]], his second cousin, teaches Gilly how to read. He also learns how the young princess survived [[Greyscale]] and that Gilly also had sisters who perished from the disease. At the choosing for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Jon reveals Stannis's offer of legitimization to Sam. Jon states that it was always his dream to be [[Lord of Winterfell]], but he reveals that he will decline the king's offer, much to Sam's surprise. When Maester [[Aemon]] asks if there are any more candidates wishing to run against Ser Alliser Thorne and Ser Denys Mallister, Sam puts Jon's name forward as a candidate. Janos Slynt mocks Sam by calling him "Slayer" and pointing out his love for Gilly being similar to Jon's love for Ygritte, and Sam retaliates by publicly mocking Slynt for hiding in the pantry with Gilly and her baby during the wildling attack."[[The House of Black and White]]"  [[left|Sam applauds Jon's election as Lord Commander.]] Sam reminds all of the black brothers present that Jon was [[Jeor Mormont]]'s personal steward, that he led the force to [[Raid on Craster's Keep|deal with the mutineers]] at Craster's Keep, and took command of Castle Black's garrison during the wildling attack when Thorne was wounded. Sam's speech ultimately results in Jon being chosen as the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  At a meeting of the Night's Watch, Jon questions Sam about Maester Aemon's absence. He reports that Aemon apologizes for his absence because he is not feeling well. Jon tells Sam to take good care of the old maester. Sam later witnesses Jon personally behead [[Janos Slynt]] for refusing to obey orders."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  Sam drafts numerous letters for Jon to sign in order to request the Northern houses to send more men to man the Wall. Jon signs all of them until Sam gives him a letter meant for [[Roose Bolton]], the new [[Warden|Warden of the North]]. Jon is against asking for help from the man who [[Red Wedding|murdered]] his half-brother, but Sam convinces him that they need all the help that they can get. Sam departs when [[Melisandre]] enters the room to speak with Jon."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  [[right|Aemon explains his sympathy for Daenerys to Sam.]] At the library, Sam reads a note from [[Slaver's Bay]] to Maester Aemon updating him on [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]'s situation. Sam praises the courage of Daenerys but Maester Aemon worries about her safety because she is all alone, under siege, and with hardly anyone to guide her, while he, as her only living relative, is useless and dying thousands of miles away. Then, Jon enters and asks to speak with Aemon in private, so Sam leaves them. Later, Sam tells Gilly about his wish to go to Citadel and become a Maester before he was sent to the Night’s Watch, when Stannis Baratheon walks in. Stannis reminisces about how Sam’s father, Randyll Tarly, defeated [[Robert Baratheon]] in the [[Battle of Ashford]]. Stannis wants to know how Sam killed the White Walker and Sam tells him how he did it with a dagger made of dragonglass. Stannis muses that it is abundantly available on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. Sam has been researching dragonglass and how it can kill White Walkers, but has yet to come up with anything. Stannis tells him to continue his research and leaves him to investigate the further weaknesses of the Army of the Dead."[[Kill the Boy]]"  [[left|Ghost protects Sam from Gilly's attempted rapers.]] Later, after Jon has left for [[Hardhome]], Sam and Gilly visit Maester [[Aemon]], who has fallen ill and grown delirious. Aemon imagines Little Sam as Egg, his long-dead brother. Aemon's condition steadily deteriorates as the day goes on, and he dies in the night. Sam eulogizes him before lighting his funeral pyre, declaring for all to hear that he was the blood of the dragon. Ser Alliser whispers that Sam's friends are abandoning him one by one. Afterward, Gilly is attacked in the dining hall by two brothers, but Sam and Jon's direwolf, Ghost, come to her rescue. Sam is badly beaten, and Gilly takes care of him before the two have sex for the first time."[[The Gift]]"  Gilly continues to tend Sam's wounds. Olly enters with some food, having heard what happened. Once Gilly leaves, Olly expresses concern at joining forces with the wildlings, particularly Tormund, who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back. Olly appears unconvinced."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  [[right|Jon confides in Sam about Hardhome.]] Samwell reunites with Jon, who is despondent, saying that the mission was a [[Massacre at Hardhome|disaster]] and they only managed to save a small fraction of the wildlings at Hardhome, where the [[Night King]], the leader of the White Walkers has revealed himself to the participants of the battle, and tens of thousands of wildlings have been raided as wights. Sam points to different wildlings passing by and notes that each of them would have died if he had done nothing at all, so it wasn't a complete failure."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[left|Sam asks Jon to be sent to Oldtown to become a Maester.]] A few nights later, Jon tells of what he saw at Hardhome to Sam. Sam asks Jon if he can travel to [[Oldtown]] to study and replace Aemon as the new Maester of the Watch. He feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight, he is also afraid for Gilly and her child's safety, and wishes to take them along. Jon reminds him that the [[Citadel]] will also not allow Sam to be with women, but is humored to hear that it is already too late for that. Sam promises he will return, they toast to that and Jon sees his only friend off."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
