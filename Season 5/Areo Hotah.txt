 5]]=== [[Areo Hotah blocks Ellaria's passage to Prince Doran.]] Areo Hotah is overlooking the [[Water Gardens]] with Doran when [[Ellaria Sand]] tries to approach the Prince. Hotah blocks her passage, and tells her that the Prince does not wish to be disturbed. In turn, she threatens him, yet Hotah does not move until Prince Doran tells him to let her pass. She berates Doran for doing nothing about [[Oberyn Martell|his brother]]'s [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|death]], and tells him that she and Oberyn's [[Sand Snakes|daughters]] want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] in order to send [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] a message. Doran strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah lets her pass, yet meaningfully indicates his axe to the Prince, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens."[[The House of Black and White]]"  As [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]] and Myrcella take a walk through the Water Gardens, Areo and Doran watch over them. The prince tells his captain that they need to protect the two, as a betrothal between two Houses who hate each other will only lead to danger for both of them. He asks if Areo remembers how to use his longaxe as it has been a long time since he used it last. Areo assures him that he still remembers how.  [[Areo threatens Jaime with his longaxe.]] Areo leads the Prince's guard to break up the fight between the [[Sand Snakes]] and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and his companion [[Bronn]], when they try to take Myrcella. [[Obara Sand|Obara]] angrily claims that they fight for [[Dorne]] and asks who he fights for. Areo repeats his command that they drop their weapons. Surrounded and outnumbered, the Sand Snakes obey, though Jaime still hesitates. Areo moves quickly and places his the blade of his longaxe at Jaime's neck, telling Jaime that he would have enjoyed fighting him had Jaime had the use of his right hand. Jaime then drops his sword and the guards take them all into custody. Ellaria Sand is also arrested for her part in the attempted kidnapping."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Areo guards Doran during negotiations with Jaime.]] Areo later escorts Myrcella to visit Jaime in his chambers, saying that Doran sent her to quiet Jaime's concerns about her safety. Areo takes his leave, and Myrcella proceeds to have a tense conversation with Jaime in which she says that her mother doesn't really care about what she wants, that Dorne is her home now, and she still intends to marry Trystane Martell."[[The Gift]]" On Doran's orders, Areo frees Bronn from custody and takes him before his lord. At Trystane's request, Areo strikes Bronn across the face in retaliation for Bronn striking him earlier, in exchange for Bronn being shown mercy. Through further negotiations, it is agreed, by all but Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, that Myrcella will return to King's Landing - with Trystane "[[The Dance of Dragons]]" Areo is later present when Princess Myrcella departs from Dorne with Jaime and Bronn."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
