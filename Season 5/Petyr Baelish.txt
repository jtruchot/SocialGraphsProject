 5]]=== [[Littlefinger watches Lord Robin practice his swordsmanship along with Sansa and Yohn Royce.]]Littlefinger attends a sword jousting session for Lord [[Robin Arryn|Robin]] at [[Runestone]], along with [[Sansa Stark|Alayne]] and [[Yohn Royce]]. Royce remarks on Robin's weak skills at swordsmanship, but Petyr insists [[House Arryn|his name]] is all that matters, not his skill. A maester delivers him a raven message, which he reads discreetly. Littlefinger leaves Robin in the care of Lord Royce, for further training. On the carriage ride, he is questioned by Sansa as to why they are heading west when Lord Royce was told they would be traveling to the Fingers, unsure of his source of distrust. Petyr promises her that they are going somewhere far away, where Sansa will be safe from Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]."[[The Wars To Come]]"  While at an inn, Petyr and Sansa are confronted by [[Brienne of Tarth]], who previously swore an oath to Catelyn Stark to keep the Stark girls safe. Petyr reminds Brienne that she swore an oath to Renly Baratheon and Catelyn Stark, both of whom are now dead, in order to stop Sansa from trusting her. Petyr attempts to "persuade" Brienne to rest with them, but Brienne and her squire, [[Podrick Payne]], escape, and discreetly continue to follow Petyr and his party."[[The House of Black and White]]"  [[Petyr tells Sansa of her engagement to Ramsay Bolton.]] However, when the party arrives at the ruins of [[Moat Cailin]], Sansa realizes that Petyr intends to marry her to [[Ramsay Bolton]], the son of Lord [[Roose Bolton]], who betrayed and murdered her brother and mother. Despite Sansa's reluctance to marry into another family that harmed hers, Petyr persuades her to go along with the plan, citing it as a chance to avenge her family. They subsequently ride through Moat Cailin, and arrive at [[Winterfell|Winterfell.]]"[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  [[Littlefinger's motives are questioned by Roose Bolton.]] Later, Petyr speaks with Ramsay and subtly warns him not to inflict any harm on Sansa. He also speaks with Roose regarding the validity of Sansa's marriage to Tyrion Lannister. Petyr insists that since Tyrion never slept with Sansa, their marriage is invalid. Roose declares that he is only interested in Sansa's name, not her virtue (after Baelish suggests he have Sansa inspected) and voices his doubts as to whose side Petyr is truly on, having essentially betrayed the Lannisters by taking Sansa away from them and returning her to the North to marry into a family that the Lannisters are no longer backing, though Petyr counters by citing Roose's betrayal of the Starks and Tullys. Roose then presents a letter for Petyr from Cersei which arrived from the Eyrie, and demands to read Petyr's reply before it is sent off."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  Later on, Petyr finds Sansa in the crypts of Winterfell paying her respects to her deceased family members. Petyr recalls about how Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Sansa's aunt, Lyanna, which started Robert Baratheon's rebellion against the Targaryen family. Petyr then tells Sansa that he has to return to King's Landing on Cersei's request. Sansa expresses unease about being left alone in Winterfell, but Petyr tells her not to worry, since [[Stannis Baratheon]] is garrisoned at Castle Black and will most likely make another try for the Iron Throne, which will require him to retake Winterfell, destroy the Boltons and win the Northern Lords to his side, and out of respect for Ned Stark's support of his claim, Stannis will rescue Sansa and name her the new Warden of the North, and if Stannis is killed or does not even come, then Petyr suggests Sansa can destroy the Boltons from within. He kisses her on the lips again and departs."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Baelish returns to King's Landing to find the city under the rule of the newly-reestablished [[Faith Militant]]. [[Lancel Lannister]], a member of the religious cult known as the [[Sparrows]], warns him that his days as a brothel owner in the capital are over. He goes to meet Cersei and he informs her of the Boltons' plans to marry Sansa to Ramsay. Angered at the Boltons' betrayal, Cersei agrees with Baelish's plans to lead an army of Vale knights to Winterfell to reclaim the North for the Lannisters, as the warriors from the Eyrie are trained to fight in winter (the weather is starting to turn at this point), but only once the Boltons and Stannis Baratheon have battled over the North and weakened both armies. In exchange, Baelish asks to be appointed as the new Warden of the North once Winterfell is taken and both the Boltons and Stannis are defeated. Cersei agrees and tells him to return that night to have the King sign a royal decree promoting him."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  [[Baelish reveals crucial information to Olenna.]] Baelish later stands in his ruined brothel with a look of regret. He is approached by Olenna Tyrell, having sent her a letter to speak with him. As they speak, Olenna mentions how her grandchildren, Margaery and Loras, have been arrested due to Cersei's machinations and demands his help by threatening that if anything happens to her or if House Tyrell goes down, she will reveal his involvement in Joffrey's murder, which will certainly lead to his execution. Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him to King's Landing for ''"a piece of information he had"'', his prostitute Olyvar, and he tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: a handsome young man â€” implied, in this instance, to be Lancel. Olenna subsequently forces Lancel to reveal the adulterous affair he had with Cersei to the [[High Sparrow]], who has her arrested."[[The Gift]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
