 5]]=== [[Missandei approaches Grey Worm.]] Missandei is with Daenerys when she learns that an Unsullied named [[White Rat]] is murdered in a brothel by an insurgence group named the [[Sons of the Harpy]], intent on removing Daenerys from power. The council questions why the Meereenese would go to such lengths, guessing that some were comfortable with the fact that [[slavery]] existed as the lowest social quality of life. Missandei then approaches Grey Worm, asking why an Unsullied would want to go to a brothel. Grey Worm states that he does not know and leaves."[[The Wars To Come]]"  [[Missandei attends Mossador's execution.]] Missandei is at Daenerys's council when they discuss what should be done with the [[Son of the Harpy]] who has been arrested following his capture by Grey Worm and Daario. Later, she is present when [[Mossador]] is publicly executed for murdering the prisoner before a fair trial could take place. She flees with Daenerys once a riot breaks out after the execution. She appears saddened when a despondent Daenerys excuses her council following the recent conflict."[[The House of Black and White]]" Missandei is present alongside Daenerys and Daario when [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] yet again tries to convince to Daenerys that the [[fighting pit]]s of Meereen should be reopened."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  [[Missandei in tears and concerned, watches over an unconscious Grey Worm.]] Missandei tearfully watches over Grey Worm as he is lying unconscious on a bed, following an attack from the Sons of the Harpy, in which Barristan is killed. She is present later when Grey Worm wakes up from lying unconscious in three days. Grey Worm states that he feels ashamed of himself for being afraid, to which Missandei responds that all men fear death. Grey Worm then says that the reason he was afraid wasn't because of death itself but because he would never be able to see "Missandei from the Island of Naath" again."[[Kill the Boy]]"  [[Missandei kisses Grey Worm during his convalescence.]] Missandei is touched with tears by this and leans over to give Grey Worm a kiss. Missandei is later asked for advise by Daenerys regarding her current situation. Missandei say that she doesn't think she is fit to give advice to a queen, which Daenerys thinks is absurd and states that she thinks Missandei is as fit as anyone to have a say in this. Missandei says that instead of listening to her counselors Daenerys should perhaps listen to her heart instead. This leads to Daenerys reopening the fighting pits and proposing to Hizdahr.  Missandei is present when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] are brought before Daenerys in the [[Great Pyramid]], after they make themselves known to the Dragon Queen when she attends the first series of duels in preparation for the Great Games at [[Daznak's Pit]]. She witnesses as Tyrion explains himself and when Jorah is again banished from Meereen."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  [[Daenerys and Missandei comfort each other during the ambush at Daznak's Pit.]] Missandei later attends Daenerys during the opening games at [[Daznak's Pit]]. She remains quiet through most of the proceedings, observing the verbal sparring between Hizdahr and Daario and looking at Dany with concern when Jorah shows up again. When the Sons of the Harpy rise up begin slaughtering the spectators, Missandei is momentarily forgotten by Daario and Jorah, who are busy trying to get Daenerys away. Missandei is rescued by Tyrion, who kills a Son of the Harpy and gets them behind a line of Unsullied. Thinking she is about to die, Daenerys grabs Missandei's hand, but the group is rescued by [[Drogon]] seconds later. Missandei and the others watch in amazement when Dany rides off on Drogon's back."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[Missandei and the council agree to keep the peace in Meereen.]] As Tyrion, Jorah, and Daario argue over how to proceed, Missandei brings Grey Worm to them. Missandei attempts to explain to Grey Worm how Tyrion saved her, trying to diplomatically avoid using the [[High Valyrian]] for "dwarf". However, Tyrion, in his typical bluntness, corrects her. She repays the favor by telling Tyrion that his High Valyrian is "rusty" as opposed to "nostril". When Daario and Jorah decide to leave the city and search for Daenerys, Daario tells the other three to stay put, since Missandei, as Daenerys's closest confidante, will be needed to help Grey Worm and Tyrion run Meereen in the queen's absence."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
