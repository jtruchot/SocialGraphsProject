 5]]=== [[Mace attends a small council meeting.]] Mace is one of the many lords present at Tywin's wake."[[The Wars To Come]]" Some time later, Mace attends a meeting of the small council. Like [[Pycelle]] and [[Kevan Lannister]], he is somewhat disturbed to see that Cersei has appointed [[Qyburn]] to replace Varys. He nonetheless hastily puts himself forward as a candidate for [[Hand of the King]], but Cersei declares that he is instead to be jointly appointed Master of Ships and [[Master of Coin]]."[[The House of Black and White]]"  Mace is present during the wedding ceremony of Tommen and his daughter Margaery. Later, Mace and the rest of the small council listen to the [[High Septon (after the Riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]] demand the arrest of all members of the [[Sparrows]] and execution of the [[High Sparrow]]. He is shocked to hear a man who is the head of the [[Faith of the Seven]] was visiting a brothel."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]" In a small council meeting Mace reveals that the [[Iron Bank of Braavos|Iron Bank]] has called in one tenth of the Crown's debts. When asked by Cersei, Mace admits that the Crown cannot pay back more than half of the demanded sum. Mace offers that House Tyrell could front the money to the Iron Throne and then be paid back afterwards, but Cersei politely refuses, stating that the Tyrells have already given too much.  [[Mace Tyrell leaves King's Landing for Braavos.]] In reality however, this is because she doesn't want to give the Tyrells any more power by granting them the ability to hold the debt payment over them. She then tasks Mace with personally traveling to Braavos to negotiate better terms with the Iron Bank. She also tells Mace that the king, concerned for his father-in-law's safety, has assigned Ser [[Meryn Trant]] to escort Mace to Braavos. Mace and Meryn leave immediately, prompting Pycelle to state that the small council grows smaller and smaller."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  After arriving in Braavos, he is greeted by [[Tycho Nestoris]] who welcomes him in the name of the Iron Bank. On the way to the Iron Bank, he talks with Tycho about the harvest in the Reach and "[[Maegor III Targaryen|Maegor III]]" who once attempted to outlawed usury. Arriving at the Iron Bank, Mace admires the facade of the enormous building, stating that the men of the Iron Bank are the world's best gamblers, much to Tycho's disapproval. After an unspecified time of negotiation, Tycho tries to bid farewell to Mace (whom he clearly dislikes due to his bumbling behaviour), but Mace does not realize this and continues plaguing Tycho on the way to the docks, loudly singing.  At night, while following Trant, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] overhears Meryn telling two Lannister soldiers how poorly he thinks of Mace and the Tyrells, going as far as calling them traitors."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
