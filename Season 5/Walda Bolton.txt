 5]]=== [[Walda and the Bolton entourage await for Sansa's arrival.]] Walda travels to [[Winterfell]] with Roose, Ramsay, and others from the Bolton household. She is there to greet Ramsay's betrothed, [[Sansa Stark]]."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]" At a "family" dinner, Ramsay remains polite toward Walda, filling her cup with wine, to which Walda thanks him with suspicion. Walda tries to sympathize with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], saying it must be difficult being in a strange place, which is something that Walda is experiencing herself. Sansa reminds her that Winterfell is her home, and states that it is [[House Bolton|the people]] who are strange. This prompts Ramsay to bring [[Theon Greyjoy|Reek]] into the room to serve more wine for everybody, including Walda, who is visibly repulsed by him.[[Walda announces her pregnancy.]] When Roose senses that Ramsay is getting too smug for his own good, he prompts Walda to announce that she is pregnant. Roose adds that from the way she is carrying [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] says it looks like a boy, which clearly distresses Ramsay but delights Sansa. Ramsay later confronts Roose about the news, expressing his concern of his inheritance to the [[North]], in the event that the child is a boy. Ramsay also takes several jabs at Walda's weight, and ponders how Roose was able to consummate his marriage.  [[Walda attends Ramsay and Sansa's wedding.]] However, Roose assures that Ramsay is and will remain his son and heir, and is to succeed him â€“ although he maintains his implied threat that Ramsay had better behave himself if that is to remain the plan, suggesting that the impending [[Battle of Winterfell (War of the Five Kings)|battle]] with [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] will also dictate the hierarchy of Walda's child."[[Kill the Boy]]" Walda is later present at Ramsay and Sansa's wedding ceremony in the godswood at Winterfell, in which Roose conducts the ceremony."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
