 5]]=== [[180x180px|Doran and Ellaria discuss Myrcella.]] Prince Doran is overlooking the [[Water Gardens]] with Captain [[Areo Hotah]] when [[Ellaria Sand]] approaches him. Angered, she berates Doran for simply doing nothing when he learned how Oberyn was murdered by Ser Gregor. Doran reminds her that Oberyn died fighting in a [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]], which by law is not considered murder. Doran intends to bury and mourn his brother, but [[Sand Snakes|Oberyn's daughters]] want Dorne to take up arms and avenge Oberyn. She also wants to harm Myrcella in order to send Cersei a message.   Doran reassures Ellaria that, as Oberyn's [[paramour]], he will always love her, but he strictly forbids her from harming Myrcella while he rules. Ellaria doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing, and then storms off. Hotah and the Prince exchange a look as she departs, the former meaningfully indicating his axe, but Doran shakes his head and returns his attention to the Water Gardens."[[The House of Black and White]]"  Doran watches with Areo as Myrcella and Trystane take another walk through the Water Gardens. The prince comments that their betrothal is dangerous as their Houses hate each other and they needed to be protected from those who would harm them. He asks Areo if he remembers how to use his longaxe, as it has been a long time that he hasn't used it. Areo reassures him that he remembers how to use it.  [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] later arrives at the Water Gardens and tries to take Myrcella, but is stopped by the [[Sand Snakes]] who also try to take Myrcella for their own ends. As [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] tries to take Myrcella, Areo arrives with the Prince's guard and arrests them all on Doran's orders. Ellaria is also arrested for leading the Sand Snakes."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" Sometime later, Doran invites Jaime to eat and drink with him, Trystane, Myrcella, and Ellaria, eager to avoid warfare. He inquires as to why Jaime came to Dorne with stealth to take Myrcella rather than send a diplomatic raven or a messenger.  [[Doran attempts to mend the Lannister-Martell alliance.]] When Jaime reveals that Myrcella's necklace had been sent as a threat to King's Landing, Doran deduces Ellaria was the one who sent the message. Jaime makes a comment about his upcoming beheading but Doran tells him that he can't behead him and that, having seen war before, he doesn't want to inflict it on his people, despite vocal cries from his bannermen for it. He offers to send Myrcella back to King's Landing on the condition that Trystane accompany her and that their engagement stand, to secure the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne. He also demands that Trystane be granted Oberyn's seat on the [[small council]].   [[Doran makes peace with Jaime.]] When she hears Doran appeasing the Lannisters, Ellaria stands and tells him that he doesn't have a spine, which explains his inability to walk. Before she storms out, Doran restrains her and warns her that, if she speaks to him as such again, her life would be short, something he doesn't want as she is mother to four of his nieces. Once Ellaria leaves, Jaime asks about his companion, Bronn. Doran asks what they would do to a commoner who struck a prince in King's Landing. Jaime takes the blame, claiming that Bronn had only been following his orders. Doran defers to Trystane to decide Bronn's punishment. Trystane agrees to release Bronn but requests that Areo slap him as he had been slapped, to his father's approval.   [[Doran forces Ellaria to end her rebellion.]] Later, he summons Ellaria before him, along with the three imprisoned Sand Snakes. He tells his brother's lover that her rebellion is over and that he will grant her mercy if she swears loyalty to him on threat of death. A tearful Ellaria kneels and kisses his ring. He then threateningly tells her that while he believes in second chances, it will be the last time he pardons her. Doran, Ellaria, and the Sand Snakes are present for Myrcella's departure for King's Landing with Jaime, Bronn, and Trystane. He bids her farewell, and gives Ellaria a nod, allowing her to give Cersei's daughter a kiss, though she has coated her lips with a fatal poison."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  Myrcella dies from the poison, though only after their boat has left the shore, while Doran remains unaware that Ellaria betrayed him again."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
