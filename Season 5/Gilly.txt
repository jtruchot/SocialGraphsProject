 5]]=== Gilly continues to help the Night's Watch by mending clothes in the courtyard of Castle Black. She tells Sam that she is aware of Ser [[Alliser Thorne]]'s hatred of her since she is a wildling and is worried about being sent away. Sam comforts her by reaffirming his promise that wherever she goes, he will go too in order to protect her. However, Gilly argues that he cannot leave Castle Black to go with her or he would be executed for breaking his vows. Later, Gilly is present when [[Mance Rayder]] is executed by [[Stannis Baratheon]] for refusing to bend the knee. Horrified by seeing someone executed in such a brutal manner, Gilly turns away before Mance is consumed by the flames."[[The Wars To Come]]"  [[Shireen teaches Gilly how to read.]] Being illiterate, Gilly has begun to learn letters from Princess [[Shireen Baratheon]], with Samwell watching over the two. Gilly also reveals to Shireen that she had sisters that also had [[Greyscale]], but they were quarantined away from the other women at [[Craster's Keep]] and eventually succumbed to the disease, after which their corpses were taken out into the [[Haunted Forest]] by Craster. Gilly remains silent when Shireen asks why he would do that (presumably to add to the [[Wight|Army of the Dead]] in service to the "[[White Walkers|Gods]]"."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Gilly tends to the dying Aemon.]] On his deathbed, Maester Aemon fondly interacts with Little Sam, recalling that his younger brother [[Aegon V Targaryen|Egg]] had a jolly laugh just like him when he was a baby. His strength failing, he also warns Gilly that she must go south with her baby before it is too late. Winter is almost upon them and the White Walkers will come with it to attack the Wall. Aemon dies soon afterwards, and is given heartfelt eulogy by Samwell, which Gilly had predicted would happen due to Aemon's declining health. [[Samwell loses his virginity with Gilly.]] After Stannis's departure, Gilly, being the only girl left at The Wall, is targeted by a few men of the Night's Watch. While getting supplies for her baby, two corner her and attempt to rape her, but Sam intervenes, ending with him getting beaten up. When they try to go at her, again, Ghost appears and scares them away. Afterwards, Gilly begins treating Sam's wounds but it quickly turns into them having sex."[[The Gift]]"  Later, when Jon returns, Sam asks him if he can travel to [[Oldtown]] to study and replace Aemon as the new maester for Castle Black, as he feels there is no other way he can help them as he cannot fight. He also wishes to take Gilly and little Sam with him, in order to protect them from the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon allows this and Sam, Gilly and the baby depart shortly after."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
