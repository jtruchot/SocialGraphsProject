 5]]=== [[Jon trains Olly in combat.]] Olly remains at Castle Black and spars with Jon in the training yard, alongside other new recruits. He has little experience with a sword and shield, but Jon does his best to teach Olly how to be a proper swordsman. Olly abruptly stops sparring when [[Melisandre]] arrives to fetch Jon. Later, Olly is present when [[Mance Rayder]] is executed by Stannis for refusing to bend the knee."[[The Wars To Come]]" Olly is present at the [[Elections#Night's Watch|choosing]] for the 998th [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]] and is happy when Jon defeats Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] for the position of Lord Commander."[[The House of Black and White]]"  [[Olly takes note of Davos and Jon's conversation.]] Jon later names Olly as his personal steward, grooming him for command as [[Jeor Mormont]] once did for him. He is present at Jon's meeting with Stannis and [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], in which Jon points out, while looking at Olly, that many of his black brothers do not like the wildlings. Later, Davos asks Olly to recite part of the Night's Watch oath in order to persuade Jon to rally the Night's Watch to Stannis's side in the upcoming battle for the North. Olly is later at a meeting of the Night's Watch where [[Janos Slynt]] refuses to man and repair [[Greyguard]], a ruined castle on the Wall. Jon orders Slynt to be brought outside. He orders Olly to bring him [[Longclaw]], thus Olly witnesses Slynt's execution."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  However, Olly's trust in Jon begins to sour after Jon makes the suggestion of allowing the wildlings to pass through the Wall and become subjects of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] or even members of the Night's Watch so as to avoid them falling into the coming [[White Walkers]]' army. First Steward [[Bowen Marsh]] points out what the wildlings did to Olly's family and friends in the Gift while in Mance Rayder's army. Later, in Jon's office, Olly asks if Jon means to lure the wildlings into a trap, but Jon denies it, reminding Olly that despite the losses they have suffered at the wildlings' hands, they will need all the help they can get if the Night's Watch is to stand a chance against the White Walkers."[[Kill the Boy]]"  Later, Olly visits Sam in his rooms, ostensibly to offer him some food. However, he wants to ask Sam why Jon would want to join forces with the wildlings, particularly [[Tormund]], who led the raid in which his parents were killed. Sam reassures Olly that Jon knows what he is doing, and that unless he is successful, neither the Night's Watch nor Westeros stands a chance against the White Walkers. Sam explains this is a hard choice Jon had to make, however unpopular, and then then tells him not to worry, as Jon always comes back."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  When Jon returns from [[Hardhome]] with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Olly is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust. When Jon smiles at Olly, the boy goes away angrily."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" [[Olly deals the last blow to the Lord Commander.]] Olly is sent to Jon's room to let him know that a wildling knows where his uncle [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] is. Jon quickly rushes out of the room, across the courtyard and past a group of Night's Watchmen, only to find a sign with the word "Traitor" scrawled upon it. Several Night's Watchmen [[Mutiny at Castle Black|mutiny against Jon and stab him]], bringing him to his knees, and Olly approaches. Jon whispers Olly's name as a plea for mercy. With tears in his eyes, Olly finishes Jon off by stabbing him through the heart, ending the mutiny and leaving his Lord Commander dead in the snow.
