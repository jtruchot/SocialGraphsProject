 5]]=== [[Ellaria threatens Areo.]] At the [[Water Gardens]], Ellaria, still in mourning clothes, observes [[Trystane Martell]] and [[Myrcella Baratheon]] from a distance. She approaches Prince [[Doran Martell]], but her path is initially blocked by Captain [[Areo Hotah]]. Ellaria threatens Areo before the captain is ordered by Doran to stand down. Angrily, Ellaria scolds Doran for his apparent inaction at the news of Oberyn's death. [[Ellaria contemptuously discusses Myrcella. ]] Doran plans to bury and mourn his beloved brother, but Ellaria and Oberyn's [[Sand Snakes|daughters]] want the Dornish people to take up arms and avenge their fallen prince. She also voices her contempt for Myrcella and wants to harm her in order to take revenge on Cersei, who she deems responsible for Oberyn's death by falsely accusing Tyrion of Joffrey's murder in the first place. Doran strictly forbids this, stating that under his rule, they will not mutilate little girls for revenge. Ellaria voices doubts that Doran will remain in power if he continues to do nothing and leaves."[[The House of Black and White]]"  [[Ellaria plots with the Sand Snakes.]] She later meets with [[Obara Sand|Obara]], [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]], and her daughter [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]], telling them that Doran will mourn for Oberyn but won't do anything. As Obara points out that they have no army without the support of the Prince to challenge the Lannisters, Ellaria says that they won't need an army because they have Myrcella, despite Oberyn's earlier promise that they would never harm her. Nymeria informs her that there's perhaps a problem, presenting her the [[merchant captain]] who smuggled Jaime Lannister to Dorne and tried to sell this information to Obara, just to end up buried in the sand. Ellaria realizes that Jaime has come for Myrcella and asks the three which way they choose, Doran's or hers. Tyene is the first one declaring for her, followed by Nymeria and then Obara, who makes her point by telling how she first met Oberyn, when she made her choice, and then she uses her spear to kill the captain."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  Ellaria and the Sand Snakes return to the Water Gardens to kidnap Myrcella and use her for their revenge against the Lannisters. They swear, by the words of [[House Martell]], to do what is needed to avenge Oberyn. However, Prince Doran had foreseen their attempt to take Myrcella and his guard, led by Areo Hotah, arrests the Sand Snakes and Ellaria for their treachery."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Doran puts Ellaria at his mercy.]] Areo brings Ellaria and the Sand Snakes before Doran, who gives Ellaria an ultimatum: she can either choose to swear allegiance to him (and that she will not try something like this again), or she can choose death. Restraining tears, she kneels and kisses his hand. Doran says that he believes in second chances and she is forgiven - but sternly warns her that he ''does not'' believe in third chances. [[Ellaria listens, angered at the prospect of securing the Lannister-Martell alliance.]] Ellaria is later brought before Doran to receive Jaime, though she is openly hostile towards him, calling him Kingslayer and refusing to drink a toast to Tommen as the new King. She is visibly shocked when Doran announces he will send Myrcella back to King's Landing along with Trystane, robbing her of her revenge. On her way out, she insults Doran, who in turn threatens to kill her if she speaks to him like that again. Later, Doran issues Ellaria an ultimatum: pledge allegiance to him, or die. She tearfully complies.  She later visits Jaime in his quarters and pretends to make amends with him, acknowledging that neither he nor Myrcella played any part in Oberyn's death. She then expresses her knowledge of Jaime's undying love for Cersei, as well as the fact that Myrcella is not Jaime's niece, but his daughter. Before leaving, she mocks him for not being born centuries ago into the Targaryen family, in which position his incest would have been accepted."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" [[Ellaria poisons Myrcella with the long farewell.]] As the Sand Snakes say goodbye to the expedition back to King's Landing, Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips. As the ship is away in the horizon, Ellaria wipes blood from her nose and takes an antidote for the poison coated on her lips, which has just taken Myrcella's life on the boat, and walks away silently, contemplating what will follow when Doran finds out that she has betrayed him ''and'' put his son's life in danger. She then takes a napkin from Tyene and wipes the poison from her lips, which she then threw into the sea."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
