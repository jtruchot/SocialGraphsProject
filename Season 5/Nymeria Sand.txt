 5]]=== When [[Ellaria Sand]] goes to the [[Water Gardens]] to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|murder]], she tells the Prince that Dorne must go to war against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], using [[Myrcella Baratheon]] as a catalyst, and points out that the [[Sand Snakes]], who have the love of [[Dornishmen|their people]], agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Nymerica practices with her whip.]] Nymeria, Tyene, and Obara meet with Ellaria to discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to Myrcella, Obara reveals information she received from a [[merchant captain]] that [[Jaime Lannister]] has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Nymeria, Tyene, and Obara agree to side with Ellaria."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  During the [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|attempted kidnapping]] of Myrcella, Nymeria initially attacks Jaime with her whip but quickly switches to [[Bronn]], aided by Tyene, while Obara drives Jaime away from the others. Obara barks at Nym to "take her" and Nym breaks off from the fight and grabs Myrcella by the arm. Myrcella resists, but Nym silences her by brandishing a knife in her face. However, as she tries to drag her away they are cut off and surrounded by [[Areo Hotah]] and the rest of Prince Doran's personal guard. Areo forces Nym and her sisters to drop their weapons, and they, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria, are arrested."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  The Sand Snakes share a prison cell next to Bronn, which proves irritating to Nym and Obara as Bronn continues singing "[[The Dornishman's Wife]]". When Tyene begins flirting with Bronn, Nym looks bored until he begins succumbing to his poisoned wound; she and Obara watch with amusement as Tyene toys with Bronn's life before finally giving him the antidote."[[The Gift]]" Nym spends her time in the cell playing a game of reflexes with Tyene, while Obara ignores them and tries to sleep. Nym mocks Tyene as she repeatedly slaps her hands, claiming she has never lost the game and that her little sister must enjoy either humiliation or pain. Tyene claims she overthinks things, causing Nym to hesitate; when she swings again, Tyene moves her hands away in time. Nym mocks her again as she offers her own hands, but Tyene instead slaps her across the face, angering her. Their argument is interrupted by the arrival of Areo Hotah."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" [[Nymeria bids a "long farewell" to Myrcella.]] Later, Nym, Obara and Tyene- bound at the wrists- witness Ellaria swear allegiance to Doran Martell, ending her rebellion."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" Nym is present with her sisters and Ellaria on the docks to see Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane off; however, Ellaria had [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|poisoned]] Myrcella with a kiss before she left on the boat. As the [[Long farewell|poison]] begins to work on Ellaria as well she drinks the antidotes, and the three sisters leave the docks with Ellaria, satisfied that they were able to avenge Oberyn, if only slightly."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
