[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] cites the [[Gift]] as a good place for the wildlings to settle because much of the farmland there is deserted. Marsh reminds him that this is because the wildlings frequently targeted the lands of the Gift in their raids of the North, citing [[Olly]]'s village as an example."[[Kill the Boy]]"  When Jon returns from [[Hardhome]] with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Marsh is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust."[[The Dance of Dragons]]" [[180x180px|Bowen Marsh stabs Jon during the mutiny at Castle Black.]] Marsh later takes part in and helps organize a mutiny against Jon, as many black brothers feel that he has forsaken the Night's Watch for the wildlings. After tricking Jon into being trapped in a corner, Marsh is the third to stab Jon, after Alliser Thorne and Othell Yarwyck, though he looks somewhat remorseful while uttering "For the Watch". He and the mutineers then leave Jon for dead as the sun rises."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
