= [[The Lord of Bones beaten to death by [[Tormund]].]]  [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] visit Hardhome to rally the wildling forces to fight the undead army. The Lord of Bones meets with Tormund, and speaks about the events which led Jon and Tormund to work together. The Lord of Bones accuses Tormund of being a traitor and makes an insulting remark about Tormund sucking Jon's cock. Before he can finish the insult, Tormund grabs his staff and beats him to death with it in front of the other wildlings.  If his corpse was not burned while the parlay was taking place, it is likely that in the aftermath of the massacre at Hardhome, the Lord of Bones was reanimated as a wight by the [[Night King]] alongside all the other dead Wildlings and brothers of the Night's Watch."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"
