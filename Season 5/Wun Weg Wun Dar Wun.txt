 5]]=== Wun Wun is present when [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund]] battle against the White Walkers. Wun Wun appears willing to support Tormund casting his vote simply by stating Tormund's name.  [[Wun Wun examines a dragonglass dagger.]] Later, when the Night's Watch is gathering the [[dragonglass]] that Jon shared with the free folk, as it can kill the [[White Walkers]], Wun Wun is holding a dragonglass arrowhead, and [[Eddison Tollett]] approaches to tell the giant to give it up, though he is too afraid to do so because of his intimidating size. Wun Wun gets annoyed by his inaction and asks ''"The fuck you looking at?"'' in the giants' rudimentary [[Old Tongue#Mag Nuk|form]] of the [[Old Tongue]]. Edd goes away quietly, without collecting the arrowhead, leaving Wun Wun with the piece of dragonglass."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  When the Wights attack the village, Wun Wun single-handedly defeats about a dozen of them by ripping them apart, stomping on them, and defending himself with a large burning log. He then retreats into the sea with Jon and the remaining defenders. Being too large for the rowboats, he simply wades out into the bay for a long distance (not drowning due to his great height) to reach the larger ships waiting off shore. He is among the few free folk to escape the [[massacre at Hardhome]], and the fleet travels back to the Wall, witnessing the [[Night King]]'s reanimation of the casualties.  [[Wun Wun arrives at the Wall.]] Alongside the other wildlings, he passes the Wall and leaves Castle Black to settle in the [[Gift]]. Many brothers of the Night's Watch are intimidated by him, having never seen a giant before."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
