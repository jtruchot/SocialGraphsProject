 5]]=== [[Ser Jorah kidnaps Tyrion, intending to take him to Daenerys.]] Jorah resurfaces in [[Volantis]], drinking in a brothel and shamefully eyeing a [[Prostitution|whore]] dressed as Daenerys. From afar, he recognizes [[Tyrion Lannister]] and Varys. Jorah later approaches Tyrion while he is urinating alone and binds him with rope and gags him, telling Tyrion that he is taking him to "[[Daenerys Targaryen|the Queen]].""[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  With Tyrion captive, Jorah steals a small boat and begins to sail east towards [[Meereen]]. En route, Tyrion pesters Jorah with muffled whining until he relents and removes Tyrion's gag. Tyrion notices that they are traveling east and not west towards Cersei in King's Landing. Jorah reveals that he is taking Tyrion to the queen he serves, Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion is pleasantly surprised and tries to convince him that they are on the same side since he was traveling to meet Daenerys anyway. He also accurately deduces who Jorah is by his appearance and equipment. He also correctly assumes that Jorah must have been banished by Daenerys because she discovered that he was spying on her for Varys. Tyrion mockingly asks Jorah if he really believes that he will earn a pardon for simply delivering him to Daenerys; alternately, she might pardon Tyrion and behead Jorah instead. Fed up with his captive, Jorah knocks Tyrion across the face, leaving him unconscious."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  [[Ser Jorah notices that his wrist has been infected with Greyscale.]] As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey, Tyrion continues to mock House Mormont, as well as Bear Island. Eventually the two find [[Old Valyria]], and passes through its ruins to find Meereen. While sailing through the ruins the two look in astonishment as they see [[Drogon]] fly past them. In a quick turn of events, [[Stone Men|men infected with]] [[greyscale]] appear and attack the two. Jorah manages to fight them off, but Tyrion is pulled underwater. When Tyrion wakes up, he finds himself on shore, saved by Jorah. Jorah and Tyrion continue but Jorah looks at his wrists, and notices he has been infected with greyscale."[[Kill the Boy]]" [[Jorah learns of the deaths of Jeor and Tywin.]] Jorah and Tyrion continue towards Meereen on foot, having failed to acquire a boat. During conversation, Tyrion mentions to Jorah that he knew his father, Jeor Mormont, from his trip to the Wall, and reveals that he was killed by his own men in a [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] while returning from a great ranging, leaving Jorah visibly saddened at his father's death. Jorah is also pressed by Tyrion for information as to why he is serving Daenerys in the first place.  [[Ser Jorah and Tyrion are captured by slavers.]] Jorah tells him that he grew to truly believe in her when he saw her emerge from Khal [[Drogo]]'s funeral pyre unscathed with three dragon hatchlings, and that she also has a birthright to the throne, even though Tyrion mentions the infamous Targaryen madness that may surface in her later in life. Later on, they are found and captured by slavers. The leader, [[Malko]], plans to sell them in Volantis, but Tyrion convinces them to allow Jorah to participate in the fighting pits in Meereen to make them rich, offering the information that Jorah once unseated [[Jaime Lannister]] in a jousting match. When Malko scoffs this, Jorah brings up that he slew Qotho in single combat, inciting Malko's interest and convincing him to take them to Meereen."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" [[Jorah prepares to meet Daenerys.]] On the outskirts of Meereen, Jorah is put on auction by Malko, who exaggerates Jorah's accomplishments by claiming that along with fighting alongside "[[Robert Baratheon|The Stag King]]", he took part in the [[Siege of Pyke|attack on "Spike"]] with his flaming sword (when it was really [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]]), single-handedly killed Khal Drogo, and was betrayed by his wife and willingly sold into slavery in order to repay his debts. A slaver, [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], buys both Jorah and Tyrion. They are taken to one of the [[Fighting pit|fighting pits]]. When Jorah learns that Daenerys is present for the opening of the games, he takes a sword and enters the arena, knocking out the other fighters while disguised with a helmet. Jorah approaches Daenerys and removes his helmet to reveal his identity, but Daenerys, who still hasn't forgiven him, orders Jorah to be taken away. Jorah informs her that he has brought a gift, and Tyrion reveals himself, meeting Daenerys face-to-face at last."[[The Gift]]"  [[Ser Jorah and Tyrion are brought before Daenerys in the Great Pyramid.]] Back in Meereen, Daenerys, after learning Tyrion wants to advise her, asks him what he thinks she should do with Jorah. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] tells her how devoted Jorah seemed to be to her and that he did not think she would be wise enough to forgive him. He then tells her how killing people devoted to her is not a ruler who inspires devotion and that she would need lots of it if she was ever going to rule Westeros, but when she did he couldn't be by her side. Daenerys then orders Jorah removed from the city once more. Jorah, with his Greyscale slowly progressing, returns to the fighting pits where [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]] remains. Since he won the earlier match Jorah demanded that he fight at the great pit in front of the queen. Jorah says he is the best he has and that if he wins he will belong to Yezzan."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  Jorah later joins the Great Games in [[Daznak's Pit]] in front of the queen, along with a Water Dancer from Braavos, a Dothraki warrior, a Summer Islander with a halberd, a Meereenese champion wielding a spear, and another fighter. When Daenerys recognizes Jorah she is visibly distraught, and as the fighting continues and Jorah is severely wounded by the water dancer, Tyrion reminds Daenerys that she could stop the fight at any moment to save Jorah.  [[Ser Jorah fighting in the Great Pit of Daznak.]] Even though the fear is clearly shown on her face, Daenerys refuses. Jorah manages to win the fight despite being outmatched. Just as the fight ends, Jorah throws a spear towards Daenerys, who, believing the spear was meant for her, ducks out of the way. The spear strikes a Son of the Harpy who was sneaking up behind her. Much of the audience reveals themselves to be Sons of the Harpy, proceeding to kill everyone they can. Jorah joins the ensuing battle for Daenerys and tries to help escort her out of the fighting pit, but they eventually end up surrounded and vastly outnumbered. At that moment, [[Drogon]] appears in the arena and starts killing the Sons of the Harpy and scaring off the rest. Jorah, Tyrion, Daario and Missandei all observe in awe as Daenerys flies off on Drogon, the first Targaryen dragonrider in over 150 years."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[Jorah, Tyrion and Daario plan their next move.]] Back in the Great Pyramid, Tyrion addresses both Jorah and Daario's feelings for Daenerys, understanding how one could love the wrong woman. The three argue about Jorah's betrayal, but they will not make any judgments without Daenerys first. The dragon was seen taking her north and it is agreed that Jorah will join Daario to ride and search for her. Grey Worm, still recovering from his injuries, offers to go with them, as does Tyrion. Daario firmly nixes both ideas: Grey Worm is needed to command the Unsullied in keeping the city under control, while Tyrion is the only one of them to have any political experience. Thus, Daario and Jorah depart together, hoping to find their Queen in the Dothraki Sea."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
