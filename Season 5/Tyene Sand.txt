 5]]=== When Ellaria Sand goes to the [[Water Gardens]] to scold Doran for his inaction to Oberyn's [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|murder]], she tells the Prince that [[Dorne]] must go to war against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and points out that the [[Sand Snakes]], who have the love of [[Dornishmen|their people]], agree with her, and that they will avenge their father if Doran does not."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Tyene and Nymeria prepare to go to war against House Lannister.]] Tyene, Nymeria, and Obara meet with Ellaria, who embraces her daughter Tyene warmly. They discuss rallying Dorne to go to war against House Lannister. When the conversation shifts to [[Myrcella Baratheon]], Obara reveals information she received from a [[Merchant captain|merchant captain]] that [[Jaime Lannister]] has been smuggled into Dorne. Ellaria insists that they must stop Jaime from reaching Myrcella. They are presented with a choice: side with Doran and have peace, or side with Ellaria and have war. Tyene is the first to speak, saying she will always side with her mother, and then Nymeria and Obara also agree to side with Ellaria."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]" [[Tyene attempts to kidnap Myrcella.]] When the Sand Snakes make their attempt to [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|kidnap]] Myrcella, Tyene battles Bronn with the help of her sister Nym while Obara goes after Jaime Lannister. Although she manages to wound Bronn in the arm with one of her daggers, the battle is quickly broken up by Areo Hotah and the rest of Doran's personal guard. After a tense confrontation, Obara commands her sisters to drop their weapons, and Tyene does so. They, along with Jaime, Bronn and Ellaria are taken into custody"[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]" and is imprisoned for their part in Myrcella's attempted kidnapping, with Bronn in the cell next to them.  Tyene seduces Bronn from behind the bars of her cell, all while asking about the cut she inflicted on him during their earlier fight. Unknown to Bronn, Tyene coated her daggers with a poison called The [[long farewell]], and her attempts to seduce him were in an effort to raise his heart rate, hastening the poison's course through his body. His vision blurs, his nose bleeds, and he collapses along a wall in his cell, blaming his hemorrhaging on the Dornish air. Tyene removes an ampoule containing the antidote from her necklace and offers it to Bronn, but only if he tells her that she is the most beautiful woman in the world. Barely coherent, he replies that she is, and is thrown the ampoule. He manages to drink it before passing out, Tyene jokingly calling him out on his handsomeness."[[The Gift]]" [[Tyene watches as Ellaria surrenders to Doran.]] As Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game of reflexes with each other (in which Nymeria is shown to be prolific at winning, only to be ousted with a slap from Tyene), Areo Hotah arrives at their prison cell to escort the three Sand Snakes to the Water Gardens. Tyene is forced to watch along with the other Sand Snakes as Prince Doran forces Ellaria to swear her allegiance to him in the Water Gardens, bound at the wrist. "[[The Dance of Dragons]]" [[Tyene and the Sand Snakes bid a "long" farewell to Myrcella.]] Tyene and her sisters later watch as Princess Myrcella departs for King's Landing along with Jaime, Bronn, and Prince Trystane. Tyene sexually jokes with Bronn and promises that they may see each other again. After Ellaria seals Myrcella's fate with a poison kiss, Tyene offers a cloth for her mother to wipe the blood from her nose, an effect from the poison coated on her lips, as they watch Myrcella's boat from afar. Though the young Lannister is killed, Ellaria survives, drinking up the antidote, with Tyene taking note of the blood dripping from her nose, showing that the effects of the poison take effect based on the victim's constitution, the able-bodied Ellaria managing to hold out longer than the dainty Princess."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
