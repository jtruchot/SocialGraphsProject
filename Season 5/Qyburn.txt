 5]]=== Qyburn is at Cersei's side when she confirms that a [[Dwarf 1|head]] brought to her by two [[Dwarf hunter 1|bounty]] [[Dwarf hunter 2|hunters]] does not belong to her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. Qyburn asks for the head for use in his research. Later on, at a meeting of the [[small council]], Cersei appoints Qyburn as the new [[Master of Whisperers]] to replace [[Varys]]. [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] protests vehemently given Qyburn's outcast status, and [[Kevan Lannister]] denounces Qyburn as a sycophant and Cersei as a power-grabber."[[The House of Black and White]]" [[Qyburn writes to Littlefinger, at Cersei's request.]] Qyburn is present at a small council meeting when the [[High Septon (after the Riot of King's Landing)|High Septon]] demands the execution of the [[High Sparrow]] after [[Sparrows|his followers]] attack him. Qyburn informs the council that the High Septon had been at [[Littlefinger's brothel]]. Later, Qyburn kills a rat as part of an experiment when Cersei enters his laboratory, giving him a message that she wants sent to [[Petyr Baelish]]. She also asks him about the state of his work, while glancing at Gregor Clegane's covered body, and Qyburn assures her it is going very well, though there is still a way to go. Soon after Cersei leaves, as Qyburn writes, Gregor begins shaking under the blanket, but Qyburn shushes him calmly."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  Qyburn is at the meeting of the small council when [[Mace Tyrell]] departs to negotiate the crown's debt with the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]]."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]" Qyburn visits Cersei while she is held prisoner by the High Sparrow, informing her of the charges being brought against her - fornication, [[treason]], [[incest]], [[regicide]] - and that Grand Maester Pycelle has sent for Kevan Lannister to serve as [[Hand of the King]]. He also informs her that [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] has become despondent following Cersei's arrest, and that he refuses to eat or see anyone. He suggests that she can simply confess to the charges and plead for mercy, subtly warning her that if there is a trial, the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]] will not wait for physical evidence to reach a verdict, only what they simply believe to be true, but she initially refuses. Finally, just before leaving her, he informs her that "the work continues," referring to his experiments on Ser Gregor Clegane."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  Eventually, Cersei confesses to her relationship with her cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] to the [[High Sparrow]], who agrees to set her free on the condition that she perform a [[walk of atonement]]. After Cersei enters the [[Red Keep]] following her walk, Qyburn hastily rushes to her side and throws a cloak over her naked body. He then speaks to Cersei softly and reassuringly as he embraces her, attempting to soothe her. Pycelle looks upon the scene with disgust. Qyburn remarks upon her poor state and bleeding feet. Qyburn then introduces the "newest member of the [[Kingsguard]]," the 7-foot tall abomination he has been working on. At his behest, the golden knight picks her up and they walk away together, further into the Red Keep so Qyburn can clean her up and treat her wounds."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
