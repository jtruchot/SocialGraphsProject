When Sansa returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay at the behest of [[Petyr Baelish]], Ramsay initially forces Theon to keep up the charade and apologize to Sansa."[[Kill the Boy]]" Eventually, however, Sansa's fury at the belief Theon murdered her brothers eventually forces Theon to finally admit that he did not kill Bran and Rickon. Stunned by this admission, her anger towards Theon cools but when she asks if he knows where they might have gone to, he breaks down and leaves the room, fearful of what Ramsay will do if and when he finds out what he just told her. However, Sansa appears to be left with a sense of renewed hope by the revelation that Bran and Rickon, in addition to Jon, are still alive."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
