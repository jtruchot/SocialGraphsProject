 5]]=== [[Othell serves as First Builder under Jon Snow.]] Othell participates in the [[Elections#Night's Watch|choosing]] of the 998th [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]]. He counts the votes and informs Aemon that there is a tie between Jon and Thorne, which the Maester breaks by voting for Jon, much to the adulation of many black brothers."[[The House of Black and White]]" Later, when the newly chosen Lord Commander Jon gives [[Janos Slynt]] the command of [[Greyguard]] and he refuses it, as it is in ruins, Jon tells Janos that Yarwyck can spare ten of his builders to help him rebuild the fort, and Yarwyck himself agrees."[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"  Othell is later present in the common hall when Jon informs them of his plan to rescue the wildlings at [[Hardhome]]. Othell is vehemently against the idea of bringing the wildlings through the gates, even when Jon informs him that thousands of women and children will die if they do nothing. Othell is unmoved and says it would be better for them to die as it would mean less enemies for the Night's Watch. [[Stannis Baratheon]] quietly mutters the word "fewer" to himself, correcting Othell's grammar."[[Kill the Boy]]"  When Jon returns from Hardhome with thousands of wildlings and lets them in through the Wall, Yarwyck is among the many black brothers who look at the wildlings and even their Lord Commander with disgust."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  [[180x180px|Othell Yarwyck stabs Jon in a mutiny.]]Othell later takes part in and helps organize the [[Mutiny at Castle Black]] against Jon, as many black brothers feel that he has forsaken the Night's Watch for the wildlings. After Jon is tricked into being trapped in a corner, Othell is the second, among Alliser, Bowen Marsh, Olly, and two other black brothers, who stab Jon uttering "For the Watch". He and the other mutineers then leave their Lord Commander to bleed out in the snow."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
