 5]]=== Jon, who has now been elected the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, ends up alienating many of his fellow black brothers when he brings back several thousand wildlings that were [[Massacre at Hardhome|driven away]] from [[Hardhome]] and allows them safe passage through [[Castle Black]]. His personal steward, [[Olly]], lures him into a trap by claiming one of the wildlings that he brought back says he knows Benjen. As Jon walks outside to see if this is true, [[Alliser Thorne]] (who Jon has since named First Ranger in place of the missing Benjen) adds that this wildling claims he saw Benjen at Hardhome on the last full moon. However, this is revealed to be nothing but a ruse as Alliser, Olly, and four other black brothers proceed [[Mutiny at Castle Black|to fatally stab]] Jon."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
