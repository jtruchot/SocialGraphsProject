 5]]=== [[Olenna returns to King's Landing, at Margaery's request.]] Feeling outmaneuvered and unsupported, Margaery hastens to write to Olenna in the wake of Loras's arrest by the [[Faith Militant]]."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]" Upon receiving Margaery's letter Olenna immediately sets off from Highgarden in a carriage and with a full escort of soldiers, reaching King's Landing several days later. On approach, the carriage halts some distance from the city for some reason, prompting Olenna to open the window to see if they've arrived. She quickly slams it shut again, since she can "smell the shit from five miles away" and orders her coachmen to continue on. She arrives at the Red Keep, promising Margaery that she will resolve the situation.  [[Olenna confronts Cersei Lannister upon her return to the capital.]] Some time later she meets with Cersei, who is pretending to be quite busy running the realm, something Olenna calls her out on. This leads to Cersei mocking Olenna's infamous tart-tongue. The Queen of Thorns, not missing a beat, fires back with "and the famous tart, Queen Cersei." Cersei continues to feign ignorance about Loras's arrest. Olenna explains that while she and Tywin didn't like each other, they both understood the need for rivals to work together, particularly given that the Reach is needed to supply most of the capital's food and if that ceases, the smallfolk will not be happy.  [[Olenna watches as Margaery is arrested.]] Cersei ignores everything Olenna says, only saying that House Lannister has no rivals. She then reiterates to Olenna that the Crown is not holding Loras, and that the High Sparrow will inevitably release him. She then invites Olenna to the inquest into the charges about Loras (as there isn't yet enough evidence for a trial). Olenna watches as her grandchildren refute Loras's sexuality, but things take a turn for the worse when [[Olyvar]]'s testimony damns them both. As Loras ''and'' Margaery are arrested, Olenna looks threateningly at Cersei."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  Olenna goes to the [[Great Sept of Baelor|Sept of Baelor]] and finds the [[High Sparrow]] washing the floors. She first tries to bribe him to release her grandchildren before repeating her previous threat to Cersei that House Tyrell will stop feeding the capital if she doesn't get Margaery and Loras back. The High Sparrow is not impressed and asks her if anyone in her House has ever harvested any of the food they own. When Olenna fails to answer, he tells her that he speaks for the many and they are learning to stop fearing the few, signalling the downfall of the Westerosi nobility and the rise of the common people.  [[Olenna receives a message from Littlefinger.]] After she leaves the Sept, a messenger gives her a message from Petyr Baelish. She goes to Baelish's ravaged brothel, where they trade barbs before Olenna accuses him of helping Cersei bring down Loras. Although Baelish denies it, she warns him that, should House Tyrell fall, she will no longer have anything to lose and she will reveal their joint involvement in [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s [[Purple Wedding|murder]]. She also warns him that, should she meet with an unfortunate accident, her agents will ensure Baelish's body is never found.  [[Olenna confronts Petyr.]] Conceding the point, Baelish reveals that Cersei summoned him to King's Landing for ''"a piece of information he had"'', his prostitute Olyvar, and he tells Olenna that he will give her the same thing he gave Cersei: "a handsome young man" â€”implied, in this instance, to be [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]]. Subsequently Olenna confronts Lancel about the adulterous affair, and he is forced to give up Cersei to the [[High Sparrow]], who has her arrested, combined with the charges of incest with Jaime and the murder of Robert (which Lancel also revealed in conversation with the High Sparrow)."[[The Gift]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
