 5]]=== [[right|The Night King raises his army of the dead during the massacre at Hardhome.]]  The Night King appears again when [[Jon Snow]] and [[Tormund |Tormund Giantsbane]] are coordinating the [[Massacre at Hardhome|evacuation]] of [[Hardhome]]. Along with a small company of White Walkers, he observes the attack from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon slays one of [[White Walker (Hardhome)|his lieutenants]] with [[Longclaw]], a [[Valyrian steel]] sword. The Night King looks on this turn of events with mild interest, shocked at his meaningful resistance. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on a boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere lifting of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome's dead but erstwhile defenders as [[wight]]s, and keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away."[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
