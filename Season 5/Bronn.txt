 5]]=== [[Bronn takes a stroll with Lollys.]] Bronn is taking a stroll with Lollys just outside of [[Castle Stokeworth]]. Lollys talks at length about the upcoming wedding, but Bronn seems uninterested about discussing it. He does comfort Lollys when she talks about her sister Falyse, saying that mean people will always get what they deserve. The two are interrupted when they see Jaime near the castle. Jaime intends to bring [[Myrcella Baratheon]] back from [[Dorne]] to [[King's Landing]] and wants Bronn to help him. He also reveals that Cersei has arranged for [[Wyllis Bracken]] to wed Lollys instead of him, which angers Bronn, as he and Cersei had an agreement. Jaime, however, tells Bronn that he will get a much better girl and a much better castle once they return. Bronn asks where they are going, and Jaime responds, "As far south as south goes.""[[The House of Black and White]]"  Bronn and Jaime journey to Dorne on board a [[Merchant captain|merchant's ship]] which is heading to [[Oldtown]], jumping ship when they reach the Dornish coastline. Having visited Dorne before, he warns Jaime how dangerous the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] are, especially since they despise the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. Bronn questions Jaime why he simply didn't send someone else to bring [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] back to [[King's Landing]], but Jaime insists that he must be the one to accomplish this task. Bronn accurately guesses that Jaime must have released Tyrion from imprisonment, which led to his [[Tywin Lannister|father]]'s [[Assassination at the Tower of the Hand|death]]. Bronn guesses that rescuing Myrcella may be the only way for Jaime to make things right with Cersei. Remembering his old employer, Bronn asks Jaime to give Tyrion his regards if the brothers ever reunite, but Jaime replies that he would kill Tyrion if he ever saw him again. At night, Bronn and Jaime land on the Dornish coast and make camp. In the morning, Bronn saves Jaime from a snake that was about to bite him, which they cook for breakfast. While eating, Bronn remarks that a snake bite would be "a shit way to die", but Jaime believes that all forms of dying are "shit ways." Bronn expresses that he would prefer to die in the comfort of his own home as his sons grovel for his money, while Jaime wishes to die in the arms of the [[Cersei Lannister|woman]] he loves. As they depart, Bronn is skeptical that the merchant captain who helped smuggle them into Dorne will keep his mouth shut, even though Jaime gave him a generous amount of gold.  [[Bronn and Jaime fight Dornish guards.]] Soon after, they are discovered by a passing group of Dornish guards. Although Bronn tries to convince them they are simply lost travelers, the [[Lead Dornish guard|leader]] orders them to throw their swords in the sand. The two comply, but Bronn swiftly dispatches two of the guards and kills the horse of another, leaving him for Jaime. Jaime manages to block a fatal blow with his golden hand and kills his opponent, while Bronn kills the fourth and final guard. Bronn is happy to finally own a Dornish stallion, but an annoyed Jaime orders Bronn to dig graves for the four guards so no one discovers the bodies."[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"  [[Jaime and Bronn reach the Water Gardens.]] Disguised as Dornish soldiers, Bronn and Jaime finally reach the Water Gardens and search for Myrcella. They find her with [[Trystane Martell]], and she is visibly surprised to see Jaime there. When Trystane attempts to intervene, Bronn advises him to step aside and let Jaime and Myrcella talk. Trystane notices the blood on Jaime and Bronn's uniforms and goes for his sword, but Bronn strikes him out and he falls to the ground. They are [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|attacked]] by the [[Sand Snakes]], Oberyn Martell's daughters who planned to kidnap Myrcella. Bronn fights with [[Tyene Sand]] and [[Nymeria Sand]], easily keeping up with both of them despite taking a small wound, until [[Areo Hotah]] and the Dornish guard appear and order them all to stand down. After a few tense moments, Bronn drops his sword and is arrested along with the others. He teases Tyene about her age, but she is restrained from attacking him."[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"  [[Bronn is poisoned by Tyene Sand.]] Bronn is locked in the dungeons along with the Sand Snakes, repeatedly singing "[[The Dornishman's Wife]]" and gaining Tyene's interest, who asks him about his arm. Bronn claims to be fine, and comments on Tyene's beauty, though comparing her unfavorably to other Westerosi women he has been with. Tyene begins to remove her clothes to raise Bronn's blood pressure, causing his nose to bleed and his head to spin, making him collapse. Tyene reveals that she had coated her knives with poison and it is slowly killing him, but shows that she has the antidote and will only give it to him if he says she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. Bronn only barely manages to say it and she throws him the antidote, which he drinks, apparently making him feel better."[[The Gift]]"  Bronn is later released from custody and brought before [[Doran Martell]] on Jaime's request. Though Doran is prepared to punish Bronn for his actions, Jaime speaks up for him, claiming that Bronn was only following his orders. Bronn's fate is left up to Trystane, who agrees to show Bronn mercy and set him free, on the condition that Hotah strike him across the face in retaliation for Bronn having struck him earlier. Hotah does the deed."[[The Dance of Dragons]]"  After being released, Bronn is at the docks with Jaime, Myrcella, and Trystane ready to board a ship back to King's Landing. As Doran sees the group off wishing them a safe journey home, Tyene flirts with Bronn, telling him she might come visit him, to which Bronn sarcastically replies not to wait too long as he's got a noblewoman to marry back home. Tyene cheekily tells him he wants a good girl but needs a bad pussy, and playfully bites his ear. Upon being called by Jaime, Bronn boards the boat that is to take them to their ship and leaves Dorne. However, after the ship has set sail, Myrcella succumbs to poison that was stealthily given to her by [[Ellaria Sand]] before their departure."[[Mother's Mercy]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
