# SocialGraphsProject

This project was made for the course Social Graphs and Interactions of the Technical University of Denmark.

This repository contains the explainer notebook of the project, as well as the data used.

Note that the tweet dataset used for the 8 season of *Game of Thrones* is not given here because it was too heavy to be pushed on this GitHub.
