 1]]=== [[Viserys and Daenerys stay at the estate of Magister Illyrio.]] Illyrio brokers the deal to "sell" Daenerys in marriage to [[Drogo]] of the [[Dothraki]]. Drogo desires an exotic wife from far away and Viserys needs a Dothraki army to help retake the [[Seven Kingdoms]], so a bargain is made. When Drogo comes to approve of Daenerys, he rides up to the steps, looks her over, and then rides off. Viserys is concerned as Drogo had not said a word nor had he even dismounted. However, Illyrio assures him that if Drogo had not approved, he would have made it known. Illyrio is present when Daenerys says that she doesn't want to marry him. Viserys says she will, and that he would let Drogo's men and all their horses rape her if it meant that in return he could get an army to help him retake the [[Iron Throne]].  Illyrio hosts the wedding and presents Daenerys with a gift of three [[dragon]] eggs, turned to stone by the passing of ages. He introduces them to [[Jorah Mormont]], a Westerosi lord in [[exile]] who then takes service with Viserys."[[Winter Is Coming]]" Drogo immediately leaves with his [[khalasar]], traveling to the far east for [[Vaes Dothrak]] to present Daenerys before the [[dosh khaleen]], and see if the omens are right for war. Jorah tells Viserys that he should stay at Illyrio's estate, as he has been invited to do, until Drogo returns from the sacred city, but Viserys says he will stay with the khalasar until he gets his army.  [[Varys and Illyrio conspire beneath the [[Red Keep]].]] Some months later, Illyrio pays a secret visit to [[King's Landing]] where he discusses their mutual plans with his secret ally, [[Varys]], the [[Master of Whisperers|Spymaster]] at the [[small council]]. Varys informs him of how the new [[Hand of the King]], [[Eddard Stark]], now has the same [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|genealogy book]] that his [[Jon Arryn|predecessor]] read, and has met Robert's [[Bastardy|bastard]] son [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]; the same evidence which led Jon Arryn to discover the truth about [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s children. Illyrio suggests the possibility that the same fate may befall Lord Stark as did his predecessor, but Varys states Eddard is not the same man as Arryn was. Furthermore, he assures Illyrio that the conflict between the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and the [[House Stark|Starks]] will soon escalate into a [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]]. Illyrio protests that a war will not serve their purpose right now, since Drogo is not yet ready to send his army of Dothraki to invade Westeros for Viserys. However, Varys retorts there is no way of delaying the incoming conflict, so the Dothraki must be urged to move faster, since "this is no longer a game for two players." Illyrio replies that it never was. Their discussion is overheard by [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who is with them in the tunnels under the [[Red Keep]]. Arya tries to warn her father about what she heard, but she doesn't know who the speakers were and out of context all she understood was that her father "has found the bastard", that "the wolves are fighting the lions", and "something about the savage." Despite their secret conversation, later at a small council meeting Varys seemingly supports Robert's proposal to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen because of the threat her pregnancy and the possibility of a son poses. This information was presumably brought to Varys by Illyrio, who placed Jorah Mormont with the Targaryens and visited Varys on the same day Varys brought this information to the small council."[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
