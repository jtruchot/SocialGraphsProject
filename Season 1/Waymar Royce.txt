Will, the best scout in the group, goes on a different path to scout.  When Will rejoins Ser Waymar and Gared, he tells them about wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Gared insists on returning to [[Castle Black]] to report the situation to the Night's Watch but Ser Waymar is unfazed. Instead, he commands the group to go to the site to determine what killed the wildlings. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Gared sends Will to find the bodies. While Will scouts around for clues, Ser Waymar is brutally slain by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] in front of terrified Gared."[[Winter Is Coming]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
