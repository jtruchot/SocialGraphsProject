= Mago attends Drogo's wedding to the [[Westeros]]i exile [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. He watches as two warriors squabble over a dancer at the wedding."[[Winter Is Coming]]"  Mago objects to Daenerys intervening and denying the [[Dothraki]] to take their share of the [[Lhazareen]] women as spoils of war. He refuses to recognize her authority as ''[[khaleesi]]'', calling her a foreign whore. He approaches and challenges the seething Drogo, slashing his khal slightly on the shoulder with his ''[[arakh]]''. The Khal fights him, disdainfully disarming himself first and deliberately accepting the ''arakh'' wound to show contempt for Mago's combat skills. He quickly gains the upper hand, slitting his opponent's throat with his own sword and yanks his tongue out through the neck wound."[[The Pointy End]]" Drogo brandishes the tongue for his court to see and casually tosses it on a pile of heads next to his seat.   Shortly after Mago's death, the wound he gave Drogo begins to fester, eventually leading to Drogo's incapacitation and subsequent death.
