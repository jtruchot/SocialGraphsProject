= Stiv, Osha, and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the [[White Walkers]]. In the woods near [[Winterfell]] they stumble across [[Bran Stark]] and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], for a reward, but decide against it. [[Robb Stark]] intervenes, and kills Wallen and disables Osha. Stiv holds a knife to Bran's throat, and despite Bran's protests not to, Robb lowers his sword as Stiv tells him to. However, [[Theon Greyjoy]] shoots him through the back with an arrow, killing him. Osha surrenders to [[House Stark|Stark]] custody."[[A Golden Crown]]"
