= He accompanies [[Eddard Stark]] south to [[King's Landing]] when he becomes [[Hand of the King]], and is usually seen guarding him with [[Jory Cassel]]. He is with Eddard when [[Renly Baratheon]] brings news of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s hunting injury. Eddard instructs Tomard to hand deliver a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]]. Tomard is not present when Eddard and the majority of his guard are killed."[[You Win or You Die]]" He escapes from the capital and successfully delivers the letter, thus he is one of very few (if any) of the Stark Household to have survived the [[Massacre in the Red Keep]]. His destination after he completes his assignment is unknown.
