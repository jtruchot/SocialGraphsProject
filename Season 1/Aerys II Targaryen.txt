 1]]=== [[King Aerys orders Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue to be cut out.]] As they travel to King's Landing, [[King]] Robert talks about having Aerys's daughter Daenerys assassinated after hearing of her marriage to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]. When Eddard protests, Robert reminds him of what Aerys did to his family. Later at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], [[Sandor Clegane]] tells [[Sansa Stark]] about how Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] hasn't had much to say since Aerys had Ser Ilyn's tongue torn out."[[The Kingsroad]]"  When Eddard arrives in the [[Great Hall]] of the [[Red Keep]], he is confronted by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], who expresses his bitterness at Eddard for judging him over his killing of Aerys, especially after he killed Eddard's father and brother. Eddard counters that Jaime wasn't motivated by justice when he killed Aerys, and that he had served him loyally when serving was safe."[[Lord Snow]]"  [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Barristan Selmy]] of the [[Kingsguard]] recounts to [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]] how Aerys ordered him to destroy the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]]. Selmy himself killed their leader, [[Simon Toyne]]. Bored and attempting to mock Ser Jaime, King Robert realizes that he never asked Jaime what King Aerys Targaryen's last words were, then taunts Jaime for killing a defenseless old man he had sworn to protect. Jaime tersely responds that the last thing the Mad King said was the same thing he'd been raving for hours, since the sack of the capital by the rebels began: "[[Wildfire|Burn]] them all!" This silences Robert's levity.  [[Aemon]], the [[Order of Maesters|maester]] sworn to [[Castle Black]], the main fortress of the [[Night's Watch]], reveals to [[Jon Snow]] that he is the uncle of King Aerys and, because of his oath to the Night's Watch, he could not interfere during the rebellion. Aemon warns Jon that he must live with whatever decision he makes for the rest of his life, and urges him to not abandon the Night's Watch after hearing of Eddard Stark's unjust imprisonment."[[Baelor]]"  [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] recalls that King Aerys was initially a good man. He then laments that he saw Aerys melt away before his eyes, as [[Targaryen madness|madness increasingly gripped his mind]] over the years and a once charming man was consumed by dreams of fire and blood.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
