 1]]=== [[Othell Yarwyck presides over Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly as they swear their oaths before the Old Gods.]] Othell Yarwyck is present for the induction of the new recruits at Castle Black. He accompanies [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] into the [[Haunted Forest]] to witness them saying their oaths of loyalty to the Watch in front of a [[heart tree]]. He is among the first to congratulate them on entering the Watch, and is also present when [[Ghost]] returns with a corpse's hand in his mouth."[[You Win or You Die]]" The party discover the corpses of [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]] and return them to Castle Black. He confirms Sam's discovery that the corpses do not smell, which is odd since they appear to have been dead for weeks. He, similarly to Jon, is in favor of burning the bodies immediately, but is overruled by Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]], who desires them to be examined first."[[The Pointy End]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
