 1]]=== Stannis is first mentioned during a conversation between his younger brother [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Loras Tyrell]], in which Loras suggests that Renly could take the [[Iron Throne]] himself. Renly points out that he is fourth in the line of succession, behind his nephews and Stannis. Loras claims that no one would support Stannis for the crown because he "has the personality of a lobster.""[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"  King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] tells [[Eddard Stark]] that he does not love his brothers, and considers Eddard to be his true brother.  After King Robert's death, and realizing the truth of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s parentage, Eddard decides to back Stannis as the rightful King. Renly offers to help Eddard take Joffrey into custody, but only if Eddard backs Renly's own claim to the throne. Eddard angrily rejects the suggestion, pointing out that Stannis has the better claim and is a skilled battle commander and leader. Renly counters that Stannis is a good soldier like Robert, but like Robert may not make the best king. Eddard later sends a letter to Stannis at his fortress stronghold of Dragonstone, informing him of the situation. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] also advocates backing someone else - Joffrey or Renly - and manipulating them from behind the scenes, since Stannis claiming the throne will plunge the [[Seven Kingdoms]] into war. Eddard is adamant that Stannis is the rightful heir.  [[Varys]] tells Eddard that Queen Cersei is more concerned about Stannis than anyone else, including the army that [[Robb Stark]] has raised. Stannis is a proven and experienced battle commander and is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies. Eddard replies that Stannis is the legitimate heir to the Iron Throne, to Varys' disappointment."[[Baelor]]"  With [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]] erupting in the Seven Kingdoms, news reaches both the Lannister and Stark camps that Stannis and Renly have made claims on the Iron Throne. Robb Stark considers declaring for Stannis, but his bannermen, having grown weary of the constant squabbling of the southern kingdoms, proclaim Robb [[King in the North]]."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
