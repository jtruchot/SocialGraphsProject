= Daenerys is unwell. Jhiqui, along with Irri and Doreah, helps her to walk to a tent. While Jhiqui and the other two tend to Daenerys in the tent, Daenerys asks them if they have seen [[dragon]]s. Irri states that dragons are gone. Jhiqui agrees and insists that there are no dragons becouse brave men killed them and it is known. Jhiqui also sides with Irri in saying that the moon is a goddess, and not a giant dragon egg as Doreah claims. Daenerys is intrigued by Doreah's "dragon egg" story and asks Jhiqui and Irri to leave her alone with Doreah."[[The Kingsroad]]"
