Robert becomes annoyed when Lancel runs out of wine and sends him for more."[[Lord Snow]]" Later, in preparation for the [[Tournament#Tourney_of_the_Hand|Hand's tourney]], Lancel tries in vain to help Robert into his armor, tactfully suggesting that it was "made too small". Robert angrily replies that Lancel's mother was a "dumb whore with a fat arse". At this point [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] enters the tent and bluntly tells Robert, "You're too fat for your armor", to the King's amusement. When Lancel also laughs, Robert sends him out in search for the "breastplate stretcher" (a snipe hunt for a nonexistent device). Eddard seems to feel sorry for Lancel, while Robert hopes that he is sent all over camp looking for this thing. Eddard says he should stop torturing Lancel."[[The Wolf and the Lion]]" [[Lancel accompanies Robert on a boar hunt.]] Lancel accompanies Robert, [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and Ser Barristan on a hunt, frequently giving Robert wine, taking advantage of Robert's altercation with Renly when discussing Robert's ability to enjoy whores no matter the political background."[[A Golden Crown]]" He is present when [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert is mortally wounded by a wild boar]]. [[Varys]] insinuates that Lancel's readiness with the wine may have been deliberate in order to slow Robert's reactions."[[You Win or You Die]]"  [[Cersei orders Lancel into bed.]] While [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is being held captive in the [[Riverlands]] by [[Robb Stark|Robb]], Lancel enters into a sexual relationship with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].
