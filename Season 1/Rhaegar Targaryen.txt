Robert tells Eddard that he kills Rhaegar every night in his dreams. Eddard tries to assure Robert that he already killed Rhaegar, but Robert laments that he could only kill him ''once''. Looking nervous, Eddard tells Robert that the Targaryens are dead now, but Robert points out not all of them are - implying he will keep hunting down the younger Targaryen children until their family is totally eradicated. Robert also mentions Rhaegar when arguing with Ned over the morality of having Daenerys assassinated. When Ned decries that killing a pregnant young girl would be a dishonorable crime, Robert angrily retorts that after what Daenerys's brother Rhaegar did to Ned's sister Lyanna, Ned shouldn't be defending them."[[The Kingsroad]]" [[Maester Aemon Targaryen shares his grief with "Jon Snow" about how his great-nephew Rhaegar was killed in the war.]] When Daenerys successfully consumes a stallion's heart and the ''[[dosh khaleen]]'' declare her unborn son to be the [[Stallion Who Mounts the World]], Daenerys declares that he will be named [[Rhaego]] in honor of her brother."[[A Golden Crown]]" When Jon Snow hears about his "father" Eddard Stark's imprisonment and faces the conflict between love for his family and duty to the Night's Watch, Maester [[Aemon]] recounts his own struggle with the same conflict.
