 1]]=== He travels the [[Kingsroad]] with his father as part of King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s retinue.  When he is encountered by [[Joffrey Baratheon]] practicing sword-fighting with [[Arya Stark|Arya]], Joffrey bullies him for 'pretending to be a knight'. Despite his protests that the weapon he was using was only a stick, Joffrey sadistically and slowly slashes his cheek with his sword, prompting Arya to attack him, throwing his sword into the stream. Mycah manages to escape, but later is killed by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] at Joffrey's orders, much to [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]'s disdain. When confronted by Ned about the foul deed, the remorseless Hound dryly says that Mycah didn't run fast enough."[[The Kingsroad]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
