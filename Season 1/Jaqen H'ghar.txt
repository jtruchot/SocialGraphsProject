When looking for fresh recruits for the [[Night's Watch]], [[Yoren]] was given permission by Eddard Stark, [[Hand of the King]], to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chose H'ghar as a potential candidate, as well as two other murderers [[Biter]] and [[Rorge]] from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.  Jaqen H'ghar is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the [[Wall]], along with [[Hot Pie]], [[Lommy]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], and Arya, who is being smuggled out to be returned to Winterfell.
