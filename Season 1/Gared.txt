= [[Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]] Gared, along with [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Will]], departs from the Wall to investigate reports of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies [[beyond the Wall]]. Will, the best scout in the group, goes on a different path to scout.  When Will rejoins the group, he reports about wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Gared insists on returning to [[Castle Black]] to report the situation to the Night's Watch but Ser Waymar is unfazed. Instead, he commands the group to go to the site to determine what killed the wildlings. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Gared sends Will to find the bodies.  While Will scouts around for clues, Gared finds a bloody piece of clothing buried under the snow. He then sees a humanoid figure with glowing blue eyes, a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]], arrives and kills Ser Waymar with ease. Gared attempts to escape but is caught and beheaded by the White Walker."[[Winter Is Coming]]"
