 1]]=== [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] meets a [[Knight of House Frey]] with a group of men at arms at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] and asks after Lord Walder's health. The knight replies that Lord Walder is well and is planning to celebrate his 90th birthday by taking a new wife. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] laughs derisively at the news, making enemies of this group."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"  When [[Robb Stark]]'s army arrives at the Twins on its march south, Robb needs to cross the river to gain a tactical advantage over the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces. As a Tully bannerman, Walder Frey had been called up, but he had delayed going until he saw which side had the advantage. Now that Riverrun is besieged by the Lannisters, Frey wonders why he should risk their fury. Catelyn tells Robb that Walder Frey is slippery and not to be trusted, despite his allegiance to her father. Fearing that Walder would attempt to imprison Robb and sell him to the Lannisters, Catelyn volunteers to negotiate with him, despite the warnings of Robb, [[Rodrik Cassel]], [[Greatjon Umber]], and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], stating that she has known Walder since childhood."[[Baelor]]"  [[Walder negotiates with Catelyn Stark as he fondles Joyeuse.]] Upon entering the Twins, Catelyn finds Walder and his vast brood of sons, grandsons and bastards. Although two of his sons, [[Stevron Frey|Stevron]] and [[Ryger Rivers|Ryger]], respectfully remind their father to remember his courtesies to Catelyn, her being the daughter of their liege lord, Walder agrees to Catelyn's request to dismiss them - including his new fifteen-year-old wife, [[Joyeuse Frey]] - while they negotiate. An alliance is formed; in return for permission to cross and the service of Walder's troops, Robb will marry one of Walder's daughters or granddaughters, whichever he likes. Additionally [[Arya Stark|Arya]], when recovered, will marry Walder's son [[Waldron Frey|Waldron]]. Robb must also take another son, [[Olyvar Frey]], as a squire. Robb consents to the match, even after his mother indicates that Walder's daughters are not particularly attractive.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
