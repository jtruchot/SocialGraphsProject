= [[180x180px|Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]]Will, along with [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Gared]], departs from the [[Wall]] to investigate reports of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies [[beyond the Wall]]. He discovers a number of wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Nearby, he also finds a dead [[wildling girl]] pinned to a tree. Will reports to his companions and leads them back to the scene but the corpses have vanished. Gared sends Will to find the bodies.  While Will searches for the wildling corpses, he notices the wildling girl who now is a [[wight]] and stalks him through the trees. Terrified, he runs away from the Wight but arrives to the horrid scene to witness a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] brutally beheading Gared. The White Walker tosses the severed head at Will's feet.  Will is later found south of the Wall near [[Winterfell]], apparently having gone renegade. He is apprehended and brought before Lord Eddard Stark for justice. Will claims that his companions have been brutally killed by the White Walkers and he fled in terror. Eddard does not believe the story and executes Will as a deserter, beheading him with his [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Ice]].  Later, at the feast welcoming [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] to Winterfell, Eddard asks his brother, Benjen Stark, if he knew the deserter Eddard executed. Benjen responded that the young member of the Nightâ€™s Watch was just a lad and he was tough, a true ranger."[[Winter Is Coming]]"  Lord commander [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] about Will's execution and that he swore he had seen a white walker killing his companions."[[Lord Snow]]"
