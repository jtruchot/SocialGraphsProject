= [[Catelyn Stark]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] stop at the Crossroads Inn, trying to be inconspicuous. The minstrel [[Marillion]] tries to make a good impression on them, which fails when he insults the North (not realizing they are Northerners). Masha Heddle tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] upon his arrival that they have no spare rooms, but Tyrion holds up a gold coin and asks if anyone has a room for him. The sellsword [[Bronn]] says that Tyrion can have his room, and Tyrion throws him the coin. Marillion attracts Tyrion's attention to their table by offering to sing Tyrion songs of his father's war victories. Tyrion remarks that nothing would more likely ruin his appetite.  [[Masha Heddle watches Tyrion's arrest.]] Though she tries to turn her face away, Tyrion recognizes Catelyn, Masha curtsies to her, as she knows she is the daughter of [[Hoster Tully]], the Lord of the Riverlands. Catelyn had not planned to do so, but she calls on the knights and men at arms in the inn, many of them sworn to her father's bannermen, to arrest Tyrion for the crime of attempted murder of [[Bran Stark|her son]]."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"
