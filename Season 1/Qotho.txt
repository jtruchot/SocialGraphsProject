When [[Mago]] defies Drogo, Qotho, along with his fellow [[bloodrider]]s, steps forward to defend Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters into his own hands. He objects to the Lhazareen godswife [[Mirri Maz Duur]] treating a small wound Drogo takes, calling her ''[[Maegi]]''."[[The Pointy End]]"  Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the Khalasar, a sign of weakness. While [[Cohollo]] comes down from his horse and kneels to Drogo's side, Qotho and [[Haggo]] remain mounted. Daenerys orders the khalasar to take camp, but Qotho objects, though he ultimately relents. Later Daenerys calls for Duur, who says that only [[blood magic]] can save him. Duur claims that she needs to kill Drogo's horse. Qotho objects to the ritual and a fight ensues; Qotho pushes Dany to the ground causing her to go into premature labor. [[Jorah Mormont]] intervenes and engages Qotho in a vicious duel. Though Qotho takes the upper hand with his younger age and superior speed, his ''arakh'' is unable to penetrate Jorah's armor, giving Jorah enough time to finish him off, slashing him across the face with his sword."[[Baelor]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
