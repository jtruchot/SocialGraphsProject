 1]]=== [[The Three-Eyed Raven guides Bran to Winterfell's crypts.]] After his fall from the tower and awakening from the subsequent coma, [[Bran Stark]] sees the raven multiple times in his dreams. In them, it appears as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop before he shoots. Then, the raven lands on the head of a [[direwolf]] statue, cries once and then flies deep into the [[House Stark|Stark family]] crypt."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]""[[A Golden Crown]]" After having the dream again, he becomes convinced the raven is guiding him to the crypts in order to somehow find [[Eddard Stark|his father]] there, even though he is supposed to be alive and well at [[King's Landing]]. Anxious to find out, he asks [[Osha]] to take him down to the crypts. There, they are surprised by [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], who admits to having had the same dreams. Outside, Osha is still trying to tell Bran that it could be a coincidence when a saddened Maester [[Luwin]] appears, holding a letter announcing Eddard's death."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
