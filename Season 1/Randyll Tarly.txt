 1]]=== Samwell recounts to [[Jon Snow]] that even though he was his father's eldest son and heir, he was disgusted with Samwell's "womanly" interest in books and learning and disdain for martial valor and combat. Soon before Sam turned eighteen, his father took him aside and bluntly told him that he was unworthy to inherit the Tarly [[Horn Hill|lands]] and [[Lord of Horn Hill|titles]]. Randyll ordered Sam to take the black and join the [[Night's Watch]]. Randyll told his son that if he did not, he would take him out on a hunt in the woods and kill him in such a way that it looked like an accident, apparently unconcerned of the fact that such an act would be considered [[kinslaying]]. Terrified, Sam did as he was bid and left Horn Hill for the [[Wall]]."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
