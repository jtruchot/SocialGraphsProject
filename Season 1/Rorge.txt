 1]]=== When looking for fresh recruits for the Night's Watch, Yoren is given permission by [[Eddard Stark]] to go through the dungeons and take any criminals who would swear to take the black. He chooses murderer Rorge as a potential candidate, as well as two other criminals (Jaqen H'ghar and Biter) from the black cells, where the worst criminals are kept.  Rorge is in the party led by Yoren that leaves King's Landing for the Wall, along with [[Hot Pie]], [[Lommy|Lommy Greenhands]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. Because Yoren is traveling so far with so few men, the worst three criminals are kept in a locked barred cell on the back of a wagon."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
