 1]]=== Daenerys's handmaiden [[Irri]] realizes that Daenerys is pregnant with Drogo's child. They throw a small feast to celebrate. [[Jorah Mormont]] is troubled by the news and sends word of it to his paymaster, [[Varys]], in [[King's Landing]]. Daenerys tells Drogo she is certain the child will be a boy."[[Lord Snow]]"  Daenerys strikes [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] after he threatens her and her unborn son."[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]" [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] orders Daenerys, her unborn child, and Viserys killed."[[The Wolf and the Lion]]" In [[Vaes Dothrak]], omens are taken and the [[Dosh khaleen|crones]] proclaim that Drogo's son will be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Daenerys names him Rhaego for her deceased brother, Rhaegar."[[A Golden Crown]]" Later, during a feast to celebrate, Viserys threatens to kill both Daenerys and Rhaego unless Drogo upholds his end of their bargain: to assist him in reclaiming the [[Iron Throne]]. This prompts Drogo to kill Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head. Daenerys and her unborn son are later nearly killed by an [[Wineseller|assassin]] sent by Robert Baratheon, although they are saved just in time by Ser Jorah's intervention. Upon learning of the attempt on the life of his wife and unborn son, Drogo declares to invade [[Westeros]] and to take back the [[Seven Kingdoms]] for Rhaego.  On the borders of [[Lhazar]], close to the [[Red Waste]], a heavily pregnant Daenerys has [[Mirri Maz Duur]] perform a blood [[magic]] ritual to save Drogo from an infected wound. Whilst the ritual is taking place, Drogo's [[bloodrider]]s object to the ritual and one of them, [[Qotho]], knocks Daenerys to the ground when she tries to stop him from intervening, causing her to go into premature labor. Desperate to help her, Ser Jorah brings Daenerys into the tent where Mirri is conducting the ritual, despite her orders not to let anyone enter. Rhaego is reportedly stillborn and comes out looking like a monster. Mirri Maz Duur claims that he had scales like a lizard, was blind with bat-like wings, and had innards full of graveworms. She also says that when she touched him, his skin fell away from his bones, and that it was his death that paid for Drogo's life."[[Fire and Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|
