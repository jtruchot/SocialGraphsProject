 1]]=== [[Jory Cassel]] and [[Jaime Lannister]] reminisce about the [[Siege of Pyke]]. Jory swears that he will remember Thoros charging through the breach with his blazing sword until his dying day.  Thoros joins [[Beric Dondarrion]] in order to help him track down [[Gregor Clegane]] on the orders of [[Eddard Stark]].  The hundred strong party was [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford|ambushed]] by Clegane at the [[Mummer's Ford]], and 60 of their number, including Beric, were killed. Though he no longer believed that the words held any power, Thoros recited a traditional prayer to the Lord of Light, asking him to resurrect Beric. To the priestâ€™s astonishment, Beric opened his eyes and returned to life. Afterwards, Thoros, Beric, and their 40 remaining companions continued on as the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. After hearing of the deaths of [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and [[Execution of Eddard Stark|Ned]], he went back to serving his religion with the rest of the Brotherhood.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|
