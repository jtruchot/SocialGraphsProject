 3]]=== [[The Three-Eyed Raven guides Bran to a tree in his dreams.]]While traveling north, Bran dreams once again of the Three-Eyed Raven. In the dream he's able to walk and attempts to shoot at him with a bow and arrow. A [[Jojen Reed|strange boy]] then appears in the dream, and tells Bran that he cannot kill the raven, because Bran is the raven."[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]" Another day, this same boy, Jojen, and his sister [[Meera Reed|Meera]] encounter Bran and his companions in real life, and Jojen explains the prophetic powers of [[greensight]] dreams to Bran. Jojen explains that he also saw the Three-Eyed Raven and it was Jojen himself in the dream (not just a prophetic vision of him), as the power of greensight, conferred by the raven, allowed his mind to enter Bran's dreams."[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
