 3]]=== Maester Aemon is still at [[Castle Black]] when [[Samwell Tarly]] returns with [[Gilly]] after [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|escaping]] from [[Craster's Keep]]. Aemon at first advises Sam that he swore an oath when joining the Night's Watch, believing that Sam fathered [[Sam|Gilly's son]]. Samwell corrects him that he is not the father, but that the girl is one of [[Craster]]'s daughter-wives, which engenders sympathy in Aemon.   [[Aemon orders Samwell to inform the nobility of Westeros of the conflict beyond the Wall.]] Because it is too dangerous beyond the Wall, Aemon relents and offers shelter to Gilly in Castle Black for the time being. Gilly thanks him and calls him "my lord", but Aemon insists that he gave up being a lord many years ago (when he joined the Order of Maesters and left House Targaryen). With the matter settled, Aemon commands Samwell to make sure all of the messenger-[[raven]]s are well-fed, and tells him to take a quill and parchment: he dictates to Samwell a request for help which will be sent to all the major lords throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]], imploring them for aid against the threat of the [[White Walkers]]."[[Mhysa]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
