 3]]=== Razdal mo Eraz is sent by the Wise Masters to negotiate with [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] when she sets camp outside of [[Yunkai]] and sends word demanding the surrender of the city. He arrives atop a palanquin carried by several slaves. After being announced, he comes too close to Daenerys but is intimidated away by her [[dragon]]s. Razdal offers Daenerys gifts of gold and ships for her to travel back to Westeros, so that Yunkai will be left in peace. Daenerys offers Razdal his own life if he goes back to the Wise Masters and ensures that all slaves are released and given payment for their years of service or else she will lay waste to Yunkai.  [[Drogon menaces Razdal.]]  Dumbfounded at her boldness, Razdal stands defiant and retorts that Yunkai has [[Second Sons|powerful allies]] and that after the coming battle the Yunkai'i will enslave the survivors, even Daenerys herself, prompting [[Drogon]] to furiously hiss at him. He reminds Daenerys that he was offered safety but she retorts that her dragons react poorly to their "Mother" being threatened. Razdal orders his slaves to take back the gold, but the enraged Drogon stands in their way. Daenerys then sends him away and keeps the gold, as Razdal returns to his palanquin, muttering curses."[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
