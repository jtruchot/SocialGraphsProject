 3]]=== [[In Slaver's Bay, the now-elderly Barristan Selmy recounts to Daenerys how he fought beside her brother Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident.]] When Daenerys Targaryen considers the possibility of buying [[Unsullied]] to employ as her army in her quest to win the [[Iron Throne]], Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] pleads with her not to do it. He recounts how, as a [[Kingsguard]], he knew Rhaegar and fought beside him at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. That day, men fought and died for Rhaegar because they believed in him and loved him. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] counters that Rhaegar fought bravely and honorably, but perished nonetheless. Daenerys asks Barristan if he knew Rhaegar well: he responds that he did, and Rhaegar was the finest man he ever knew - the last dragon. Daenerys is saddened, as Rhaegar died before she was born, and says she wishes she had known him - but he was not the last dragon (she is)."[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
