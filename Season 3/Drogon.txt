 3]]=== Drogon has grown significantly since leaving Qarth, and is about the size of a small dog by the time Daenerys and her party reach [[Astapor]]. He swoops into the water and catches a fish, which he then cooks in mid-air and devours. Daenerys notes that he is not growing fast enough for her to use him to conquer the Seven Kingdoms in the immediate future.  At Slaver's Bay, she speaks with [[Kraznys mo Nakloz|Kraznys&nbsp;mo Nakloz]], as they attempt to work out a deal for his slave soldiers, the [[Unsullied]]. Daenerys says she will take all eight thousand Unsullied, including those in training. To this Kraznys laughs at her and says even with the wealth she possesses she could afford hardly over one hundred Unsullied. Daenerys surprises him by reminding him she has Dragons, and she will give him one. They strike a deal that she may have all the Unsullied, as well as those still in training, in exchange for her biggest dragon.  [[Drogon burns Kraznys during the Sack of Astapor.]] Sometime later the exchange is made, and Daenerys meets with the [[Good Masters]] and gives the chained Drogon over to Kraznys, who in turn gives her the golden scourge which signifies absolute authority over the Unsullied. Once the Unsullied are under her command, Kraznys angrily comments that Drogon does not obey him, to which she responds, in Valyrian, that he does not obey because dragons are not slaves. Daenerys orders Kraznys's death with a harsh "dracarys." Drogon then takes flight and strafes the guards and Good Masters in the walls above the plaza.  After the [[Sack of Astapor]] is finished, Daenerys's khalasar and her new Unsullied army march out of the city, with Drogon and his brothers flying overhead.  [[Daenerys marches forward with her army and dragons.]] Drogon and his brothers are present in Daenerys's tent when a Wise Master from [[Yunkai]] arrives to entreat with their mother. Drogon, now about the size of a large dog, aggressively barks at the Master when he gets too close to Daenerys. Later, the Wise Master has two slaves place a chest full of gold near Drogon. While the two talk, Daenerys throws a piece of meat to Viserion, and Drogon attempts to steal it from his brother. When the negotiation goes sour, Drogon growls at the Wise Master for threatening Daenerys. Scared for his safety, the Wise Master tells his slaves to take back the gold and leave. Drogon stops them in their tracks, hissing, and growling.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
