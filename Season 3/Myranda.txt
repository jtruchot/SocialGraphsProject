 3]]=== [[Violet and Myranda sexually manipulate Theon.]] Myranda and [[Violet]] enter the torture cellar in which [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is kept hostage, release and put him on a bed. Then they attempt to seduce him, claiming they have heard the heir to [[Pyke]] is "well endowed". Violet claims Myranda was in training to become a [[septa]], but her sexual urges kept her from taking the vows. Theon is initially distrustful, but cannot help but grow aroused when Myranda, stripped of her clothes by Violet, straddles him.  Suddenly, they are interrupted by a horn sounded by Ramsay Snow. He taunts Theon and tells him that he has also heard about Theon's manhood, before pulling out a gelding knife. Myranda and Violet then watch with amusement as Theon begs for mercy, while being held to the floor by [[Bolton soldier 1|two]] [[Bolton soldier 2|men]] and castrated by Ramsay. Afterwards, as Theon is still tied to the cross, Ramsay taunts him about being a eunuch."[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
