Edmure initially refuses (partly because he, in contrast to Robb, is not allowed to choose between Lord Frey's daughters), but eventually consents after bowing to family pressure, as well as his desire to make amends for his blunder at the [[Battle of Stone Mill]]."[[The Climb]]" [[Roslin is carried away at her bedding ceremony.]] Edmure does not meet Roslin until she is unveiled at the wedding. Having seen Walder's other daughters, Edmure was shocked and relieved to see Roslin at last. She glances at Robb, who turns to Walder, who gives him a rather sarcastic look.
