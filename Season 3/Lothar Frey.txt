 3]]=== Lothar travels to [[Riverrun]] with Lord Walder's [[Bastardy|bastard]] son, [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder]], and meets with King [[Robb Stark]] and his advisors to discuss the reforging of the [[House Stark|Stark]]-[[House Frey|Frey]] alliance for Robb's planned attack on [[Casterly Rock]]. The Freys carry Lord Walder's demands, which includes a formal apology from Robb, the castle of [[Harrenhal]] and all of its lands and incomes, and for [[Edmure Tully]] to marry [[Roslin Tully|Roslin]], one of his daughters. Edmure is reluctant to marry a woman he has never met, but is eventually convinced to go through with the arrangement."[[The Climb]]"  [[Lothar kills Talisa.]] Lothar hires a group of assassins to pose as musicians at Edmure and Roslin's [[Red Wedding|wedding]]. [[Talisa Stark]] comments on their talent, and Lothar replies that they should want to be good due to their cost. After the [[bedding]] ceremony, Lord Walder rises to make a toast to Robb and offer a marriage gift to his Queen, signaling Lothar to draw a knife from his sleeve and repeatedly stab the pregnant Talisa in the stomach, fatally wounding her and killing her unborn child. Angered by the atrocity visited upon his wife and child, Robb prepares to draw his sword and most likely go after their killer, but he takes a few arrows by the musician-assassins hired by Lothar, who presumably continues to participate in the ensuing massacre."[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|
