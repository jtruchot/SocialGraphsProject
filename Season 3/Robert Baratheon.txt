 3]]=== Cersei claims that at some point prior to his death (possibly as he lay mortally wounded after the boar hunt), Robert specified that he did not want to be buried in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in King's Landing, where the remains of previous kings from the Targaryen dynasty are interred; instead, as per Robert's instructions he was buried alongside his forefathers at his family's ancestral castle, [[Storm's End]]."[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"  Meanwhile, Robert's bastard Gendry - having now survived imprisonment under Gregor Clegane at [[Harrenhal]] as well as the massacre back in King's Landing - is now traveling with the outlaw group called the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] who ultimately exchange him to the red priestess [[Melisandre]] in exchange for two bags of gold. Unaware of what she intends to do with him, Gendry is initially cordial towards Melisandre who reveals the truth about his father as they pass the Red Keep. They arrive at Dragonstone where Gendry meets his uncle Stannis, who refers to his nephew as "half Robert, half low-born." Melisandre later seduces Gendry before quickly tying him to a bed and leeching his blood as part of a ritual to help Stannis's quest for the Iron Throne. However, Gendry is later freed by [[Davos Seaworth]] before Stannis and Melisandre can completely sacrifice him thus preserving Robert's bloodline."[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
