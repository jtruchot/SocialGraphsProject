 3]]=== Lord Hoster finally passed away shortly after the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Hoster's brother Brynden, son Edmure, daughter Catelyn, and grandson [[Robb Stark]] are present for his funeral at Riverrun. As per Tully funeral tradition, his body is set adrift on the Red Fork of the [[Trident]] River in a funeral boat, and then set on fire by a flaming arrow - so that his ashes will return to the river which sustains their lands. Brynden tells Catelyn that he and Hoster managed to make peace before his death. Hoster told Brynden to stop calling himself "The Blackfish" as it is an old joke and it wasn't very funny to begin with. Following Hoster's death, his son Edmure inherits his titles and lands, and officially becomes the new head of House Tully.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|
