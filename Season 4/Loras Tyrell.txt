Jaime attempts to intimidate Loras into calling off the wedding, warning him that Cersei will murder him in his sleep, along with any children they may conceive together. Despite having no affection whatsoever for Cersei, Loras retorts to Jaime that he will never be able to marry Cersei either, clearly aware of Jaime and Cersei's relationship. He walks off, leaving Jaime nonplussed."[[The Lion and the Rose]]"  During the re-enactment of the [[War of the Five Kings]] by dwarfs in full costume, Loras looks on as the one dressed as Stannis (riding [[Melisandre]]) attacks another one dressed as Renly (riding a crude naked depiction of Loras). Following a sequence in which the Stannis dwarf stabs the Renly dwarf in an echo of the real murder, Loras, distraught and disgusted, leaves his seat on the dais altogether and doesn't return. Joffrey is later poisoned with the [[strangler]], after which Tyrion is accused of his murder. Unknown to most, Olenna is the true perpetrator. [[Loras silently watches as Tyrion defends himself.]] Loras later attends the coronation of [[Tommen Baratheon]].
