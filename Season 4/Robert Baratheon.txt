 4]]=== When Joffrey is assassinated at his own [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]], Tommen becomes the heir apparent despite the "rumors" about his actual parentage. As he stands vigil with Cersei and Tywin over Joffrey's corpse in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], Tywin proceeds to grill Tommen as to what makes a good king. At one point, Tommen asks about strength and Tywin refutes this by pointing out that Robert was a paragon of strength but ultimately not a good king. He goes on to cite that during his 17 year rule, Robert only attended a scant ''three'' meetings of his own small council."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
