 4]]=== Yohn Royce is present in the tribunal, hearing the testimony of Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] about the death of [[Lysa Arryn]]. Along with Lady [[Anya Waynwood]] and Ser [[Vance Corbray]], he assumes foul play on Littlefinger's part, whose plea for innocence is based on the assumption that Lysa committed suicide.  [[right|Lord Royce and Lady Waynwood talk with Littlefinger.]] He openly expresses his dislike of Littlefinger, calling him a whoremonger, money-grubber, and liar, as well as pointing out his tendency to suck up to [[Tywin Lannister]] in the past. The tribunal then summons Littlefinger's niece, "Alayne", the only other witness. Lord Yohn is surprised to learn of Alayne's true identity - [[Sansa Stark]]. Satisfied with her testimony, Royce and Waynwood discuss the Vale's next move with Baelish. He suggests that it is long past time that Robin left the Eyrie and conducted an official tour of the Vale.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
