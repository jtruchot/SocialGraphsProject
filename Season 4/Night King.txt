 4]]=== [[right|The Night King approaches an altar-like ice formation where Craster's son is placed.]] The Night King first appears in a vision that [[Bran Stark]] has when Bran [[Greensight|communes]] with a [[Weirwood]] [[Heart tree]]. He experiences a flood of images from the past, present, and future, many of which he was not physically present for. He does not comprehend what all of these images are but, in retrospect, one of them is an image of the Night King picking up the last of [[Craster]]'s sons off an ice altar."[[The Lion and the Rose]]"  [[left|With a touch of his finger, the Night King turns Craster's final son into a White Walker.]] After [[Rast]] places [[Craster's last son]] on the ground in the [[Haunted Forest]], a [[White Walker (Oathkeeper)|White Walker]] takes the baby to a shattered mountain in the [[Lands of Always Winter]], placing the baby on an icy altar ringed by large icy spikes. A group of thirteen black-garbed White Walkers are revealed to be viewing the proceedings from afar. One of them breaks from the middle of their number and approaches the altar, stopping to regard the human child for a moment before gently gathering him in its arms. The baby immediately calms, staring into the face of the Night King. He places his index finger upon the baby's cheek, causing the child's eyes to turn icy blue and its skin to grow pale: most likely the fate of Craster's other sons."[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
