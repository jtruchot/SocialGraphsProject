 4]]=== After Jaime returns to King's Landing, Cersei lists off to him all she has suffered since he left for the war over two years ago, one of which is that their daughter Myrcella has been shipped off to Dorne to secure a political marriage-alliance."[[Two Swords]]"  During the [[Purple Wedding|royal wedding]] between King Joffrey and [[Margaery Tyrell]], Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] encounters Lord Tywin, the man he holds responsible for letting Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] rape and kill his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], and also killing her [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|two]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|children]]. Oberyn introduces his [[paramour]], [[Ellaria Sand]], to Myrcella's mother Cersei. The four of them exchange smiling pleasantries which barely hide their underlying and mutual loathing for each other. At the end of their encounter, Oberyn casually points out that Myrcella is still in Dorne; while Oberyn hints that a [[ward]] can easily become nothing more than a [[hostage]], he also taunts Cersei and Tywin by stating that murdering little girls is frowned upon in Dorne."[[The Lion and the Rose]]" Tommen is crowned king after Joffrey is poisoned at his own wedding, making Myrcella the heir to the Iron Throne, as Stannis is in open rebellion and thus held as an unlawful claimant."[[First of His Name]]"  While conversing with Oberyn, Cersei laments that she has not seen Myrcella in over a year. Oberyn informs her that the last time he saw Myrcella she was swimming with two of [[Sand Snakes|his daughters]] in the [[Water Gardens]], laughing in the sun. Cersei states that she wants to believe this story, and that Myrcella is happy. Oberyn gives her his word, stating again that they do not hurt little girls in Dorne. Cersei replies that they hurt little girls everywhere in the world. Cersei asks Oberyn to bring Myrcella a gift from her, as she missed her [[nameday]] and does not know when she will see her again. Oberyn agrees and Cersei points to a ship that the best shipwrights in King's Landing have been building for months, declaring that Myrcella loves the open water. Oberyn promises to have it sailed down to Sunspear for Myrcella. Cersei asks him to please tell Myrcella that her mother misses her very much. Later, Oberyn meets with Tyrion in his prison cell, and recounts his meeting with Cersei. Oberyn says he half-suspects that Cersei was actually lying, and was exaggerating how much she misses Myrcella in order to guilt him into siding with her against Tyrion during the trial - though her performance was so convincing that part of him also wonders if it was true. Tyrion explains that the trouble with Cersei is that she mixes lies with truth to suit her own ends: part of her is worried about Myrcella, but she isn't above cynically using this grief to gain sympathy from others."[[Mockingbird]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
