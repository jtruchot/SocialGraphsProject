 4]]=== Theon, now going by the name Reek, has been freed from his restraints, but on the condition that he work for Ramsay as a servant. Because of his torture and emasculation by Ramsay, Theon is now mentally weakened and offers no resistance to his new lord. He accompanies Ramsay and [[Myranda]] on their hunt for [[Tansy]], however he struggles to keep up with them due to his injuries. When Myranda brings down Tansy with an arrow to the leg Ramsay asks Reek if it was a good shot. Reek calls it a fine shot while addressing Ramsay as "Master" and Myranda as "My Lady." Reek watches in silent horror when Ramsay orders his [[Bastard's girls|pack of hounds]] to maul Tansy to pieces.  [[Ramsay asks Reek about what remains of House Stark.]] Ramsay brings Reek before Ramsay's father, [[Roose Bolton]]. Roose is angered that Ramsay has damaged a valuable hostage, whom he intended to trade for the ironborn-occupied [[Moat Cailin]]. To demonstrate their captive's submissiveness, Ramsay orders Reek to shave him. Reek reveals to Roose that he did not murder [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]], and that they may be with their half-brother [[Jon Snow]] at [[Castle Black]]. Ramsay then reveals to Reek that [[Robb Stark]] is dead, and was stabbed through the heart by Roose. Reek holds the razor at Ramsay's neck briefly but continues shaving. When Roose orders [[Locke]] to find and kill the Stark boys, the latter asks Ramsay if his "pet rat" has any thoughts on where they went. Without saying a word, Ramsay orders Reek to answer Locke's question by simply giving him a look. Reek sadly tells him that they may be with [[Jon Snow]] at [[Castle Black]]."[[The Lion and the Rose]]"  Yara, along with a group of ironborn, infiltrates the Dreadfort to [[Assault on the Dreadfort|rescue]] her brother, only to find him in one of the kennels. Believing that this may be another one of Ramsay's tricks, Reek desperately refuses to abandon his master, refusing to be Theon Greyjoy and screaming to be left alone, insisting that he is Reek. Soon Ramsay arrives with a group of Northmen. As the two sides fight each other, Reek keeps resisting to be taken and bites Yara's hand to return to his cage. Yara escapes after being rejected and Ramsay unleashing his hounds at her. As a reward for his demonstration of loyalty, Ramsay offers Reek a bath, though Reek is hesitant to remove his clothing, due to the many scars of his torture and his earlier castration. After Reek gets into the tub, Ramsay cleans his servant himself and demands a demonstration of Reek's love: his help to get a castle back. Reek's task is to masquerade as Theon Greyjoy."[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"  [[Ramsay reminds Theon of his scheme.]] Outside of [[Moat Cailin]], Ramsay goes over Reek's mission with him one last time: he is to enter Moat Cailin under the guise of Theon Greyjoy, prince of the Iron Islands, and attempt to negotiate with the ironborn garrison holding it in an attempt to convince them to surrender the fortress to the Boltons. Reek rides up to the fortress gate, and almost blows his cover when asked to identify himself, yet manages to regain his composure and convince the ironborn to let him to enter. [[Reek enters the ruined fortress of Moat Cailin under the guise of his former self.]] Upon riding into Moat Cailin, Reek finds it in a state of death and decay, littered with corpses and the few remaining men ravaged by disease and exhaustion. He introduces himself as Prince Theon and truthfully informs the ironborn that he has been a prisoner of House Bolton and has been sent to Moat Cailin as their envoy. He reads the terms that House Bolton has laid out for the ironborn, promising them safe passage home if they peacefully surrender Moat Cailin.  [[Reek pleases Ramsay by helping the Boltons retake Moat Cailin.]] However, [[Ralf Kenning]], the garrison commander of the ironborn, decries Reek's words as those of a "whipped dog" and that he is no true ironborn, nearly causing Reek to become unnerved and drop his facade. However, Reek is saved when one of Kenning's own [[Adrack Humble|men]] suddenly buries an axe in his head and accepts Reek's terms of surrender. However, the ironborn are promptly massacred and flayed by Ramsay and his men after they surrender. Ramsay reveals to Theon that he never intended to let the ironborn go, and congratulates him by patting him.  In the aftermath, Ramsay meets with [[Roose Bolton|his father]] and presents him with the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]] banner that was flying over the fortress. In recognition, Roose presents Ramsay with a decree of [[legitimization]], making him officially a member of House Bolton. Delighted at the knowledge he will succeed his father as [[Warden|Warden of the North]], Ramsay and Reek accompany Roose's army as it approaches the ruins of Winterfell, with Ramsay gleefully informing Reek that he's ready for a hot bath."[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
