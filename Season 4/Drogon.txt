 4]] === [[Drogon snarls a warning at his mother when she tries to interrupt his feeding.]] Drogon and his brothers are now the size of small horses. He quietly rests his head on his mother's lap as she caresses him. When his two brothers come back with a dead lamb, he joins the fight over the carcass. His mother tries to calm him down, and without warning, Drogon snaps at her with a hiss; a warning to not interfere. He then roars and goes to contest the kill. Daenerys is shaken, fearing that she is losing influence over her "children", as dragons can never be truly tamed."[[Two Swords]]"  [[Drogon preys on goats to feed near Meereen.]] Following Daenerys's conquest of Meereen, Drogon, who is now the size of a small ship, kills and eats the goats of a local [[Goatherd (The Laws of Gods and Men)|goatherd]]. The goatherd lays the charred bones of his flock before Daenerys in her throne room, hoping he has not angered the new queen and that this was a form of punishment. Daenerys apologizes for Drogon's actions and promises to pay the goat herder back three times the worth of his lost goats."[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"  Dany is later dismayed to learn that Drogon has killed the young [[Zalla|daughter]] of [[Goatherd (The Children)|another goatherd]]. She tearfully confines the two smaller dragons to the catacombs of the pyramid while Drogon remains at large, having last been seen over the [[Black Cliffs]]."[[The Children]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
