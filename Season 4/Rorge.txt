= Arya and the Hound come across a homestead recently burned and pillaged by Rorge and Biter. After granting a [[Dying man|mortally wounded peasant]] a merciful death, The Hound is suddenly ambushed from behind by Biter and bitten. The Hound overpowers Biter and kills him by snapping his neck. Rorge appears. He tells them about [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's death]], and says there is a price on Sandor's head. The Hound is unimpressed, but Arya remembers Rorge as the prisoner of the Watch who threatened to molest her; he is not on her kill list because she doesn't know his name. Answering the Hound's question, Rorge reveals his name, then Arya kills him with Needle."[[Mockingbird]]"
