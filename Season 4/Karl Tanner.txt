= Grenn and [[Eddison Tollett|Edd]] arrive at Castle Black after escaping from their captivity at Craster's Keep. They reveal that Karl is the ringleader of the mutineers, and that they are content with staying at the keep, eating Craster's food, and raping his daughter-wives."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  [[Jon Snow|â€‹Jon Snow]] then points out that they know about the small garrison at Castle Black and proposes that they should be killed so they won't disclose it to the wildlings.  At [[Craster's Keep]], Karl drinks wine from the skull of [[Jeor Mormont]], drunkenly bragging about himself and his skill as a hired killer back in King's Landing before ordering Rast to "feed the [[Ghost|beast]]". One of Craster's former wives enters the Keep and presents Karl with Craster's last child, a [[Craster's last son|son]]. The women call for it to be given to the gods, which Karl realizes must refer to the White Walkers. Realizing that this was how Craster protected himself from the White Walkers, Karl orders Rast to take the child out into the forest, leaving it behind. Soon after, [[Bran Stark|Bran]], [[Jojen Reed|Jojen]], and [[Meera Reed|Meera]] are captured and taken to Karl, who threatens to kill Meera and Jojen until Bran admits his true identity as Jon Snow's half-brother."[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"  With his new captives in hand, Karl attempts to rape Meera, but is interrupted when Jojen offers to help him if he lets her go. After hearing that "[[greensight|the sight]]" could show him the future, the uninterested Karl sarcastically asks if Jojen had seen what his captors were going to do to Meera. As he turns to her again, Jojen announces that he saw Karl die, and his corpse burned and buried by snow on this very night. This claim gives Karl pause, but before he can muster a proper reply, a commotion is heard outside. Rast runs in to announce that Jon Snow and a handful of the Night's Watch loyalists have arrived to [[Raid on Craster's Keep|raid the keep]]. Karl kills one before Jon confronts him. He mocks Jon by bragging about the freedom he's experienced since the mutiny.   [[180x180px|Karl is slain by Jon.]] He duels Jon and initially Karl gains the upper hand, because his daggers are better suited to the cramped space inside the building than Jon's sword, and he uses dirty tactics like spitting in Jon's face to distract him. Before he can finish Jon, however, one of Craster's daughter-wives stabs Karl in the shoulder. Karl turns around and pulls the dagger from his back and prepares to kill her, however, he neglects one of the principal tenets of combat -- never turn your back on an opponent. Jon snatches up [[Longclaw]] and drives her through the back of Karl's head, killing him.  Karl's body is later burned along with those of the remaining mutineers and slain brothers inside the Keep at the behest of Craster's women and to ensure that they cannot come back as Wights. Snow begins to fall, thus fulfilling the entirety of Jojen's prophecy."[[First of His Name]]" Though gone, Karl's dirty tactics enable Jon to later defeat [[Styr]] in battle."[[The Watchers on the Wall]]"
