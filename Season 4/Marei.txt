 4]]=== [[Marei makes love with Ellaria.]] Marei is the second of three prostitutes being offered to [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Ellaria Sand]] by [[Olyvar]] (the [[Whore (Two Swords)|first prostitute]] was dismissed as too timid). Ellaria is delighted to see that Marei is "not timid". When Oberyn asks her if she likes women, Marei says that she does, as long as they look like Ellaria, prompting the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] [[paramour]] to compliment Marei's good taste. She begins kissing Ellaria, but they are interrupted when Oberyn storms out of the room to confront two [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers."[[Two Swords]]"  Marei later services Ellaria during a private orgy also involving Oberyn, Olyvar, and a [[Whore (Warrior)|third prostitute]], possibly to celebrate the recent assassination of King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] at [[Purple Wedding|his own wedding]]. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] then interrupts, entering the room and saying he wants to discuss political matters with Oberyn in private - particularly, that he wants Oberyn to be a judge at his son Tyrion's [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]], and will give him a seat on the [[small council]] to ensure that Dorne continues to support Joffrey's younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Marei and the other prostitutes quickly leave, along with Ellaria."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
