 4]]=== [[Olyvar flirts with Oberyn.]] Olyvar has been left in charge of Littlefinger's brothels, presumably replacing [[Ros]]. When [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Ellaria Sand]] arrive in [[King's Landing]], they visit the brothel and Olyvar presents three prostitutes to the couple. After Ellaria chooses [[Marei|one]] and dismisses the other two, Oberyn turns his attentions to Olyvar. The latter protests that he's not on offer, before giving in and admitting he's just "wildly expensive". Oberyn asks if Olyvar has ever been with a prince before, orders him to remove his clothes and grabs him by the crotch. However, they are interrupted when Oberyn overhears a pair of Lannister men singing ''[[The Rains of Castamere]]''."[[Two Swords]]" [[Ellaria forcefully kisses Olyvar.]] Olyvar later takes part in a small orgy involving Oberyn, Ellaria and [[Marei|two]] [[Whore (Warrior)|other]] prostitutes. Ellaria kisses Olyvar, who politely refuses her, claiming to have "not acquired the taste" for women. He then presses Oberyn to divulge his own preference. The Prince, however, explains his rather fluid approach to sexuality, a common trait among the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]]. Olyvar and the other prostitutes depart when [[Tywin Lannister]] unexpectedly arrives to speak with Oberyn."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
