 4]]=== [[right|Ygritte fletches her arrows.]] Now awaiting Mance's signal south of the Wall, Ygritte and Tormund rest. Despite wanting revenge for his betrayal, Ygritte still loves Jon, a fact that Tormund picks up on. Ygritte insists that all three arrows found their mark, but says that Jon may still have survived. Knowing Ygritte's skill as a markswoman, Tormund says that if Jon is still alive, it is because she didn't want him dead. A group of [[Thenns]] led by [[Styr]] arrives, bearing food from a raid farther south. When Styr asks if Ygritte is Tormund's woman, she claims that she belongs to no one and points a threatening arrow at the Thenn. He ignores it and takes a seat next to the fire to cook his meat: a human arm.  After his recovery from Ygritteâ€™s arrows, Jon admits he had laid with a wildling girl. [[Janos Slynt|Slynt]] calls for Jon's execution for breaking one of his vows, but [[Aemon]] objects."[[Two Swords]]"  Ygritte and the wildling band attack a village and kill almost all of its inhabitants. She kills a villager named [[Guymon]]. Styr orders Guymon's son [[Olly]], vengeful on killing Ygritte, to run to Castle Black to warn the Night's Watch about the impending attack, in the hopes that the brothers would leave Castle Black to protect nearby villages, leaving them vulnerable to the southern attack."[[Breaker of Chains]]"  [[Ygritte spares Gilly and Sam's lives during the sack of Mole's Town.]]Ygritte participates in the attack on [[Mole's Town]]. She is ambushed by a [[Mole's Town whore|whore]] in the Mole's Town brothel, but swiftly kills her with a spear thrust into her gut. Ygritte then discovers [[Gilly]] and [[Sam|her son]] in hiding, but spares their lives and motions for them to be quiet so they will not be found by other and less merciful wildlings."[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"  On the Wall before the [[Battle of Castle Black]], Jon attempts to describe to [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] how it felt to sleep with Ygritte, but finds it difficult to express it.  Just outside Castle Black, Ygritte gets into a heated argument with Styr over her feelings for Jon, motivating her to resolve to kill him herself and reestablish her tarnished reputation among her own people. The wildlings then see Mance Rayder's bonfire signal to attack Castle Black. Ygritte scouts Castle Black's defenses and reports back that most of the men are on the Wall and few remain in the Castle. The group prepares to attack, while Ygritte seems to have second thoughts. During the battle, she kills numerous brothers of the Night's Watch, including [[Pypar]].  [[Ygritte dies in Jon's arms.]] Cornering Jon Snow, Ygritte aims an arrow at him. Seeing him weakens her resolve and she hesitates, only to have [[Olly]] shoot her through the chest from behind. Jon holds her in his arms, and she weakly asks if he remembers the cave where they made love - where she said she wished they could stay forever and not have to face the war and death outside. Ygritte says they should have stayed in that cave. When Jon insists that they will return there, she tells him "''You know nothing, Jon Snow''" and then dies."[[The Watchers on the Wall]]"  [[Ygritte's body being prepared for her funeral pyre.]] After the arrival of [[Stannis Baratheon]] at the Wall, Jon speaks with Tormund, who is now a captive of the Night's Watch. Tormund asks Jon if he loved Ygritte, and, when Jon does not respond, says that she loved him very much, as the only thing she talked about after Jon left her, was killing him. He convinces Jon to have her body burned [[beyond the Wall]]. Thus, Jon takes Ygritte's body to a grove in the [[Haunted Forest]] and makes a funeral pyre before a [[weirwood]] tree, burning his love's body with tears in his eyes."[[The Children]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|
