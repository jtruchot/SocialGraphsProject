= [[Mag emerges from the Haunted Forest, via mammoth.]] During the [[Battle of Castle Black]], Mag approaches the [[Wall]] on the back of a [[mammoth]]. He rides up to the front gate and dismounts, at which point he and [[Dongo]] take the mammoth and turn it around while several wildlings tie ropes to it, then they tie the other end of the ropes to the gate's supports. While the mammoth tries to pull the gate open, men of the [[Night's Watch]] throw down flaming barrels of tar, which explode and drive the mammoth off. Dongo attempts to chase after it, but this brings him within the firing arc of a large ballista mounted atop the Wall. The ballista bolt impales him from behind and he is killed.  [[180x180px|Mag charges towards Grenn's group inside the Wall.]] Mag is enraged at the death of his fellow giant and bellows out a fearsome cry. His already incredible strength swelled with anger, Mag manages to lift the massive gate with his bare hands. He succeeds in passing underneath, though it slides closed again when he releases it. Mag then charges through the icy tunnel to the portcullis in the middle. [[Grenn]], [[Donnel Hill]], [[Cooper]], and three others are waiting for him and terrified, but Grenn rallies his men by leading them in reciting the oath of the Night's Watch, finishing just as Mag collides with the gate.  After the battle ends, [[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] find Mag's body in the tunnel beneath the Wall, along with those of the men he fought, who successfully held the gate at the cost of their own lives."[[The Watchers on the Wall]]"  When Jon treats with Mance in the wildling camp, Mance asks what happened to the giant who managed to get inside the gate, but who never came out. Jon explains that he died, killing six black brothers including Jon's friend Grenn. Saddened, Mance tells Jon that the giant's name was Mag the Mighty, the giants' king - the last of a bloodline which stretched back to long before the arrival of the [[First Men]] in Westeros. In mutual respect, Mance and Jon drink to the memory of both Mag and Grenn.
