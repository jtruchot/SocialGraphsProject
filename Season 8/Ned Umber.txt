= [[right|Ned requests more horses and wagons for his house.]] Ned is assembled with several other Northern Lords when Jon arrives with Daenerys and her army, observing the Dragon Queen with curiosity and trepidation. He is then seen in the Great Hall of Winterfell with the assembled lords discussing the [[breaching of the Wall]] at [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. Since [[Last Hearth]] is the closest castle to the breach, Sansa tells Ned to return to Last Hearth to gather his bannermen and return to Winterfell. He requests more horses and wagons to speed up the process of getting his people to Winterfell, awkwardly addressing Jon and Daenerys as well, and leaves the Great Hall once his request is granted."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"  Later, at Last Hearth, Ned is found dead by a combined group of Free Folk, Night's Watch, and the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] led by [[Tormund]], [[Beric Dondarrion]], and [[Eddison Tollett]]. He has been pinned to a wall in the castle's great hall, at the center of a spiral of severed limbs with a knife in his hand. Beric states that the spiral symbol is a message from the [[Night King]].  [[left|Beric Dondarrion burns a reanimated Ned.]] Ned, who has been reanimated as a [[wight]], awakens to the sound of the three conversing and lets out an unholy scream that startles the men before lashing out at Tormund with his knife. Beric quickly finishes the wight with his flaming sword, immolating Ned and the spiral in the process and finally killing the undead boy.
