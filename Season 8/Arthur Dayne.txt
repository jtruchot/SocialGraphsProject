= While flipping through ''[[The Book of Brothers]]'', [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] comes across a section on Ser Arthur Dayne. In it, he is erroneously shown as the third son born to Lord Symon of [[House Gaunt]]. However, it later corrects itself to say he was the son of Beric Dayne."[[The Iron Throne]]"  Deeds of his mentioned in the book are: suppressing the Kingswood Brotherhood, relieving [[White Harbor]] from the [[Siege of White Harbor|siege]] of the [[Sea Kings]], rescuing [[Rickard Stark]] from drowning, unmasking Ser [[Harlan Grandison]] of the Kingsguard as the Mystery Knight, being appointed to the Kingsguard when he was twenty years old, killing the [[Bandit Lords]] to free the [[Lord of Blackhaven|Lord]] and Lady of [[House Dondarrion]], subduing [[Steffon Baratheon]] who in drunken stupor tried to violate the dignity of a noble lady, working for the betterment of the smallfolk. It also mentions his rivalry with Prince Rhaegar, him knighting [[Jaime Lannister]] at the age of fifteen and his death at the Tower of Joy.
