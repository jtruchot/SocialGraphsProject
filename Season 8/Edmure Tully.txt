=  [[Edmure assents to Bran's election as King of the Andals and the First Men.]]  Edmure is at some point released and takes part in the trial of Tyrion, a few weeks after the [[assassination of Daenerys Targaryen]]. He re-acquired his lordship over Riverlands at an unknown point of time after Arya poisoned the males of House Frey. With Tyrion suggesting to the lords of the Seven Kingdoms that they choose the new king, Edmure puts his name forward, but is promptly dismissed by [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], who respectfully but sternly tells him to sit down. Realizing that he has only made a fool of himself in front of the other lords and ladies, he withdraws and takes his seat, but not before accidentally hitting his sword on his chair. He also is dismissive of [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] when he proposes a democratic election, joking that they should ask the dogs as well. He later consents to making Bran the new [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]].[[The Iron Throne]]
