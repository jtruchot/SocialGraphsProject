Sensing that Daenerys could remove Tyrion from the position of Hand of the Queen for having underestimated his sister, Jorah goes to Daenerys and vouches for Tyrion, insisting that he learns from his mistakes and that he should remain her Hand, even though Daenerys considered Jorah himself for the position before his betrayal was revealed. Jorah also advises Daenerys to try and build a more cordial relationship with [[Sansa Stark]].  [[Jorah attends a war council.]]Jorah's advice is heeded by Daenerys during a war council, in which she orders Tyrion to hide in the crypt during the battle as he is too valuable for her to lose. He later attempts to convince his younger cousin [[Lyanna Mormont]] to remain far from the battle in order to preserve the future of [[House Mormont]], but she refuses, and wishes Jorah good luck in the fight to come. Jorah is then approached by Samwell, who gives him his family sword [[Heartsbane]], and Jorah promises to wield it in memory of his father Jeor. He then rides into battle as the army of the dead has arrived."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"  As the battle is about to begin, Jorah and his [[Dothraki]] cavalry are approached by [[Melisandre]], who sets fire to the cavalry's blades to help them in their fight against the dead.
