= At Bran's urging, Sam informs Jon that he isn't the son of Ned Stark, but the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar, and that his true name is Aegon Targaryen. Jon reacts incredulously, doubting his father would lie to him all his life, but Sam says that Ned lied to protect Jon from [[Robert Baratheon]], who would've killed him if he had found out the truth. Sam tells Jon that he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne as Aegon Targaryen, the Sixth of His Name, rather than Daenerys. Jon, however, who has mutually fallen in love with Daenerys, rejects the crown."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"  Jon and Daenerys stand near Lyanna's statue in the Crypts of Winterfell.

He tells Daenerys the truth about himself, that he is their son. A stunned Daenerys states that Jon, as the trueborn son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, is the "last male heir" of House Targaryen."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"
