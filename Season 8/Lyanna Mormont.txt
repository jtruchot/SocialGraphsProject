= [[Lyanna questions Jon's abdication.]] Lyanna Mormont is present at Winterfell when Jon Snow returns with Daenerys and her armies. When Jon introduces Daenerys to Sansa, Lyanna looks distrustfully to the Dragon Queen. Later at a meeting, Lyanna firmly criticizes Jon Snow for renouncing his crown as King in the North, even going so far as openly questioning whatever Jon is after he declared Daenerys as his queen. However, Lady Mormont sits down when Jon states that he brought the North a strong ally and that it doesn't matter whether he is their king."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"  As Winterfell prepares for the imminent arrival of the army of the dead, Lyanna and her cousin Jorah have an argument in the courtyard. Jorah strongly advises her to remain out of the fray, as she is the future of House Mormont, but Lyanna stoutly refuses, wishing her cousin good luck before leading her men away."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]" [[Lyanna kills a wight giant as it crushes her.]] During the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], Lyanna commands the defense of Winterfell's courtyard. After the castle's walls are breached, a [[Giant (The Long Night)|wight giant]] storms through the gates of Winterfell and knocks Lyanna out of his way. Injured, she gets up and charges toward the Giant, but he lifts her, crushing both her and her armor with his clenching fist. Near death, Lyanna musters the strength to deliver a final blow, a dragonglass dagger straight into the Giant's eye, killing him. The giant falls dead and Lyanna succumbs to her injuries. When the [[Night King]] brings back the dead, Lyanna is resurrected, but once the Night King is killed by [[Arya Stark]], it is presumed she is wiped out along with the rest of the wights and White Walkers (unless she was already destroyed in the fighting)."[[The Long Night]]"  [[right|Lyanna's body on a funeral pyre.]]Together with the others fallen in the battle, Lyanna's body is placed on a funeral pyre. Jon Snow sadly looks upon her before he lights the pyre."[[The Last of the Starks]]"
