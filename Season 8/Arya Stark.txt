= Arya stands among the [[Smallfolk|residents]] of the [[winter town]] as they watch Jon, Queen Daenerys Targaryen, and their combined forces march through the town to Winterfell. She notices Gendry among the entourage, but he doesn't appear to notice her. When [[Drogon]] and [[Rhaegal]] fly overhead, roaring, Arya is the only person among the crowd who doesn't appear startled or frightened; on the contrary, she is visibly fascinated by the dragons. She is not present in Winterfell's courtyard when Jon and Daenerys arrive before the Stark entourage, and Sansa replies that she is "lurking somewhere" when Jon inquires about her.  [[Arya reunites with Jon.]] She silently approaches Jon in the godswood; when Jon asks how she could move so stealthily, Arya asks how he survived a knife through the heart, to which Jon replies that he didn't. After a moment's hesitation, the two run into each other's arms. Jon notices that Arya still has Needle and asks if she's ever used it and Arya quietly replies, "Once or twice." Jon shows her his sword [[Longclaw]], which Arya is impressed by but comments it would be too heavy for her to wield. Jon asks where she was earlier, saying he could have used her help with Sansa as Sansa is at odds with Daenerys, the latter who Jon bent the knee to and fell in love with. Arya realizes, "[Sansa] doesn't like your queen, does she?" and says Sansa is the smartest person she knows. Jon is surprised Arya is now defending Sansa; Arya replies both she and Sansa are defending their family, advising Jon not to forget he's family too and they embrace a final time. [[Arya reunites with Sandor.]] Arya later visits Winterfell's forges and comes upon Gendry presenting the Hound with a custom-made axe of dragonglass, which the latter is not especially impressed with. She tells him to stop insulting Gendry's work and the two lock eyes. Before he leaves, the Hound gives Arya a back-handed compliment; calling her a "cold little bitch", but saying that's probably why she's still alive.  [[Arya reunites with Gendry.]] Alone, Arya and Gendry exchange banter, recalling their past time together and she asks him to craft a special weapon for her. Although skeptical, Gendry agrees. Arya shows him her dagger of Valyrian steel, and he playfully replies that he always knew she was just another highborn girl. Before leaving, Arya cheekily shoots back that Gendry doesn't know any other highborn girls."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"  With the news that the army of the dead has taken [[Last Hearth]] and is advancing towards Winterfell, the inhabitants of the castle increase the speed of their preparations. Arya returns to the forges and asks Gendry if her weapon is ready, but he is still crafting her design. Annoyed, she tells him to prioritize it, before asking him what fighting the wights was like. Gendry replies, "Bad. Really bad." Arya is unsatisfied with "really bad" and keeps pushing for details until Gendry sums up their likeness in one word: "death." Gendry says that whatever bravery and fighting skill she has, the wights are like nothing she's ever faced. Unperturbed, Arya casually picks up three dragonglass daggers and throws them, one after another, into a wooden beam over Gendryâ€™s shoulder, landing them in a tight formation. While doing so, she explains [[Many-Faced God|her familiarity with death]] and her excitement of what is to come, and Gendry stands, mesmerized at her deadpan surety and confidence.  While practicing her archery, Arya receives her weapon from Gendry: a quarterstaff mounted with dragonglass blades. When she asks what happened between Gendry and Melisandre, he tells her of the [[leech ritual]]. She probes him further, forcing him to admit his parentage as Robert's bastard, and asks if he was a virgin before the ritual. Gendry claims that he was not intimate with Melisandre, but admits that he has before slept with three girls.  [[Arya gives into her feelings for Gendry.]] Arya, due to her ability to distinguish truth and lies (via her mastery of the "Game of Faces"), changes topic and states that since the two of them are likely to die soon, she wants to know the feeling of physical love before she does. She kisses him forcefully on the lips, after which Gendry shows some slight resistance, but he finally gives into the overwhelming sense of attraction, though he is briefly startled by the scars on her rib cage. Gendry sleeps soundly after their liaison, whilst Arya lies awake, awaiting the arrival of the [[White Walkers]]."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"  As the battle commences, Arya is stationed on the walls overlooking the battlefield alongside Sansa. After the wights easily defeat the initial charge of Dothraki screamers and begin to overwhelm the living beyond the trench, Arya tells Sansa to go to the crypts and hands her a dragonglass dagger. Sansa says she doesn't know how to use it, and Arya simply says "stick 'em with the pointy end. Arya shoots flaming arrows at the wights as the army retreats into the Winterfell, narrowly saving the Hound as well. As Daenerys couldn't light the trench as planned, due to being caught in a blizzard conjured by the White Walkers, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] orders the archers to light the trench and Arya shoots into it as well, however the arrows arrow doused as soon as the hit the trench and are unable to light it. Melisandre manages to light the trench, giving the living some moment of reprieve, which when the Night King commands some of the wights to go into some parts of the trench, smothering the flames and allowing the rest to cross. [[Arya fights the dead on the ramparts of Winterfell.]] Arya participates in the fighting on the ramparts with the dragonglass weapon Gendry made for her. She skillfully kills off many wights, much to Davos's surprise, but is nearly surrounded and narrowly escapes. However, she loses her weapon in the process and sustains a head injury after being knocked into a doorway by a wight. Disoriented and bleeding from the gash at the side of her head, Arya feels a newfound fear for the wights. Arya escapes through a window into the castle, as she traverses through the corridors, she takes a dead soldier's dragonglass dagger. [[250x100px|Arya hides from the wights.]] Making her way from the library, she takes a brief moment to catch her breath before she realizes that wights have entered the room. She carefully hides from them, between the bookshelves and underneath a table. Arya then throws a book into an area of the room away from the exit, distracting the wights and giving her an opening to escape. She quietly dispatches a wight on the way and closes the door behind her. Her relief is short-lived, as more wights broke into the corridor through another door and alert the ones in the library of her presence, proceeding to chase her. [[Beric incinerates a wight, saving Arya.]] Beric and the Hound have entered the castle to find and rescue Arya. She appears when a wight tackles her through a door, breaking it off its hinges, and prepares to kill her when she's pinned underneath him. Beric throws his flaming sword into it and helps her to her feet. More wights come through the doorway and Beric is stabbed in the leg whilst the Hound fights more wights. As the three try to escape the corridor, Arya watches as Beric runs in front of her to pin a wight to a wall and gets stabbed by more wights. Arya picks up a dragonglass hatchet and kills the wights hurting him, but the Hound picks her up and leaves Beric as more wights swarm in.  [[Beric dies after saving Arya.]] The two make it into the great hall, which is littered with dead bodies, and Beric makes it too but succumbs to his wounds shortly afterwards. Melisandre appears, saying that Beric had fulfilled his purpose. Arya states that she remembers her and that the red priestess said they would meet again. She recounts what Melisandre said to her; that she would shut many eyes forever. [[Melisandre reminds Arya of her destiny.]] Melisandre confirms this, reminding the colors of the eyes, including blue - those of the army of the dead. At this, Arya goes through a realization. As wights try and fail to enter through the door, Melisandre asks "what do we say to the God of Death?" and Arya replies "not today", reminding her further of her training under Syrio Forel and her abilities gained from her time as an acolyte of the Faceless Men. They share one last look before Arya leaves her and the Hound. The [[Night King]] arrives to the godswood after his army cleared the path for him, and prepares to kill Bran after killing Theon. However, Arya slips past his forces and launches a surprise rear attack with her [[Valyrian steel dagger]].  [[Arya kills the Night King.]] Though he reacts swiftly enough to whip around and catch her by the neck and arm, Arya drops her dagger from the arm he is restraining, catches it in her free hand and plunges it into his heart, causing the Night King to shatter into icy shards. With his death, the White Walkers shatter as well, and the horde of wights, including [[Viserion]], drop dead as the magic animating them died with the Night King and his lieutenants, bringing an end to the White Walkers, wights and the [[Long Night]] forever."[[The Long Night]]" [[Arya attends the cremation of the fallen.]]  Arya is present when the bodies of those who fell during the Battle of Winterfell are set to be cremated. After Jon finishes his eulogy, she is handed a torch and goes to burn the pyre where Beric was laid. In the subsequent celebrations, Arya chooses not to participate, not entirely welcoming as being hailed as the "Hero of Winterfell." Gendry later seeks her out and finds her practicing her archery, narrowly avoiding getting hit by one upon doing so. He tells Arya that Daenerys legitimized him and he's now the new Lord of Storm's End. Gendry also kneels, and confesses to Arya that he loves her, and wants to marry her and have her become the Lady of Storm's End.  [[Arya silently judges Daenerys's conquest of Westeros.]] Arya, at a loss for words, reciprocates this by kissing him but declines the proposal. She says that any woman would be lucky to marry him, saying "that's not [her]", words she said to her father years earlier. Arya continues to practice her archery and Gendry is left heartbroken.  Later, Arya attends the discussions regarding Daenerys resuming her conquest of Westeros. While Daenerys asserts that King's Landing must be taken as soon as possible, Sansa counters that their men are exhausted from fighting the White Walkers and need rest, to which Arya silently agrees.  [[Arya and Sansa express their lack of faith in Daenerys.]] Jon reaffirms his loyalty to Daenerys's cause and states that the North will march to King's Landing, much to his sisters' displeasure. As the meeting's adjourned, Arya blocks Jon before he could leave the room and all the siblings all go down to the godswood to talk. Arya and Sansa express their distrust towards Daenerys while Jon defends her, stating she is the reason they survived the battle. Arya concedes that Jon did the right thing when he bent the knee to Daenerys as they needed Daenerys's dragons and her army, but adds that they're doing the right thing when they tell Jon they don't trust Daenerys. Jon insists they just need time to get to know her but Arya says they'll never know her because she's not one of them. Jon protests they can't only trust the people they grew up with and Arya replies she only needs her family, they are the last of the Starks. Jon responds he's not a Stark; Sansa and Arya disagree, Arya telling Jon, "You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother." This prompts Jon to decide to tell his sisters the truth of his heritage - but only after they swear this information to secrecy. Once Arya and Sansa vow not to tell, Jon has Bran tell them. [[Arya and Sandor depart Winterfell.]] As Sandor leaves Winterfell, he hears the sound of another horse approaching him and sees Arya. Arya moves to ride alongside Sandor, who inquires why she was leaving. Arya vaguely hints her intentions and Sandor likewise does. It becomes clear to both of them that they intend to seek their long-awaited respective revenge on Cersei and the Mountain, whilst having no intentions to return to Winterfell. The two proceed to ride towards King's Landing, reminiscent of when they were together years before."[[The Last of the Starks]]" The two arrive at the camp of the Northern army the night before battle is set to begin. They are initially stopped by the Night Guard, but are allowed to continue when she states that killing Cersei may prevent a siege. [[Arya bids farewell to Sandor.]] Arya bluntly informs the guard that she came to kill Cersei, and it doesn't take much persuasion from the Hound for the guard to allow them to pass. The two enter King's Landing and manage to infiltrate the [[Red Keep]] amid the crowd of refugees scrambling inside. As the buildings of the Red Keep start to collapse all around them, Arya is still determined to carry out her revenge on Cersei. However, Sandor, witnessing the destruction being wrought by Daenerys on top of Drogon, dissuades Arya. He earnestly discourages her from ending up like him - beaten down by the world and driven by nothing the desire for vengeance. She thanks him, calling him 'Sandor' for the first time, and bids a final goodbye before fleeing.  [[Arya awakens to the destruction of King's Landing.]] Arya tries to flee the city but is trapped in by the mass of scared people fleeing the dragon's flames. She tries to rescue the inhabitants but is knocked unconscious, unable to help anyone. Regaining her consciousness after the [[Battle of King's Landing]] is over, she witnesses the city in ruins and leaves on a horseback, shell-shocked by Daenerys's massacre."[[The Bells]]" [[Arya attends the Great Council.]] She later reunites with Jon and warns him against his loyalty to Daenerys because of his bloodline and Sansa's refusal to bend the knee to her in the future. She also witnesses Daenerys' speech to the Dothraki and Unsullied. Weeks after Daenerys is [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinated]], she takes part in [[Great Council of 305 AC|the trial of Tyrion]]. When [[Yara Greyjoy]] agrees with the idea of Unsullied doing whatever they want with Jon, Arya threatens to kill her. Davos however manages to defuse the situation. Tyrion then suggests that the lords of Westeros choose their new king or queen and recommends Bran. Arya assents, though she withholds her vote as Sansa declares the North's independence at the meeting.  [[Arya bids farewell to Jon.]] After Bran exiles Jon into the [[Night's Watch]] to prevent a war with the Unsullied, the Stark siblings bid him a final farewell on the docks of King's Landing. Arya informs them all that she has decided to sail to the west of Westeros, where no one has ever gone before, fulfilling her promise to Lady Crane. When Jon asks if she has Needle with her, she assures him that she does. She later captains a ship flying the Stark sigil, and departs into uncharted waters."[[The Iron Throne]]"
