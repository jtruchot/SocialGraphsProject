= [[right|Daenerys tells Samwell of her role in the death of his father and brother.]] Sam is studying in Winterfell's library when Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] come to visit him. Daenerys thanks the man that saved Jorah's life from [[greyscale]] and asks if she can offer him anything in return. Sam requests a pardon for stealing books from the [[Citadel]], as well as "borrowing" his family's sword, [[Heartsbane]]. Hearing this, Daenerys realizes that Sam is the son of Randyll Tarly and informs him that his father refused to bend the knee and was [[Battle of the Goldroad|executed]]. Sam is shaken by the news of his father's death, but jokes that at least his brother will allow him to return to Horn Hill. When Daenerys reveals that Dickon was also executed, however, Sam is visibly upset and chokes back some tears. He then asks to leave the library to gather his composure."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"  Outside, Sam sees [[Bran Stark]] and asks why he's in the courtyard. Bran states he's "waiting for an [[Jaime Lannister|old friend]]" and reminds him it is time to tell Jon the truth about his parents. He then says that Sam must be the one to tell Jon, because Jon trusts him more than anyone.  Sam finds Jon by himself in the crypts of Winterfell. He confronts Jon about the death of his father and brother, asking if he would have done the same thing in Daenerys's position. He then tells Jon about the diary entry he found from [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|High Septon Maynard]] stating that he annulled the marriage between [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and [[Elia Martell]], that Rhaegar then married [[Lyanna Stark]] and that Jon was their true born son, all of which Bran confirmed using his [[Greensight|greensight]]. Jon, visibly shocked at the revelation, says that Ned Stark is the most honorable man he has ever known and cannot believe that Ned would have lied to him his whole life. Sam reminds Jon that Ned lied to protect him from [[Robert Baratheon]], who would have killed him if he ever found out the truth of Jon's parentage. Sam goes on to state that Jon is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, and asks rhetorically whether Daenerys would give up her crown to save her people as he did.  The next day, Sam and Jon welcome the arrival of Edd, [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Tormund]] to Winterfell, who inform the two that [[Last Hearth]] has [[Fall of Last Hearth|fallen]] to the White Walkers, and that they'll be at Winterfell before the next sunrise, forcing Winterfell to immediately prepare for battle.  [[left|Sam joins his family in the crypts.]] That evening, against Jon's advice, Sam volunteers to help defend Winterfell, due to his combat experience. Later, after overhearing an argument between Jorah and [[Lyanna Mormont]], Sam provides the former with his family's sword, Heartsbane, since it is made of Valyrian steel and will be much more useful in the hands of Jeor Mormont's son. Sam then joins Gilly and Little Sam in Winterfell's crypt."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"  [[right|Sam battles a wight during the attack on Winterfell.]] However, Sam later decides to participate in the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], armed only with two dragonglass daggers. He is nearly killed by a wight in the heat of battle, but is saved by Edd, only to watch in horror as Edd is quickly killed by another wight. Sam manages to retreat inside Winterfell, but breaks down and cries as the living are slowly overwhelmed by the Army of the Dead. Fortunately, [[Arya Stark]] kills the Night King, saving Sam and other survivors of the battle."[[The Long Night]]"  After the battle with the dead, Sam takes part in the mass funeral, lighting the funeral pyre with Edd's body on top, and the celebrations at Winterfell. Before departing to fight the Lannister forces at [[King's Landing]], Jon bids farewell to Sam, who informs him that Gilly is pregnant with his child."[[The Last of the Starks]]"  [[left|Sam suggests the smallfolk be allowed to elect the monarch.]] After the [[Battle of King's Landing]] and the [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassination of Daenerys]], Sam takes part in the trial of Jon and [[Tyrion Lannister]] at the [[Great Council of 305 AC]]. Tyrion states that they need a new king to pass judgment and asks the lords and ladies present there to choose one. Sam suggests that everyone in the Seven Kingdoms be allowed to choose a new king, but was mocked for this idea by all the lords and ladies, who found it ridiculous. After Tyrion suggested that [[Bran Stark]] be chosen as the new king, Sam was the first one to assent to the proposal."[[The Iron Throne]]"  Samwell was chosen as the new [[Grand Maester]] by Bran after his election. After his appointment, he assisted [[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]] with the [[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|title of his history book]] recounting the wars in Westeros after the [[assassination of Robert Baratheon]], which he showed to Tyrion, the new [[Hand of the King]], at the first [[small council]] meeting. When Tyrion asks what the book states about him, he reluctantly replies that he isn't mentioned.  [[right|Grand Maester Samwell takes part in the first reformed small council meeting.]] When King Bran arrives and asks if they have heard anything about [[Drogon]], he tries to state that he was last seen flying east of [[Volantis]], but is interrupted by [[Bronn]] before he can complete his sentence. After Bran goes looking for the dragon himself with his [[greensight]], Tyrion discusses with him about clean water improving the health of people, based on his experience with the Casterly Rock sewers. Sam tries to inform him about the research done by Ebrose on this subject, but is interrupted again by Bronn who sums it up as "the strong live and the weak don't." Tyrion then assigns Sam to hire the best builders for building a proper sewage system and providing clean water to [[King's Landing]]. When Bronn suggests rebuilding the brothels, Sam is dismissive of the idea.
