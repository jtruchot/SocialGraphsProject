= A prisoner aboard the [[Silence|''Silence'']], Yara asks Euron why he has not killed her, to which Euron sarcastically remarks upon their familial status as the last living Greyjoys, excluding Theon due to his castration. In addition, he prefers her company over his tongueless crewmen. She correctly assumes they have returned to [[King's Landing]], having ferried the [[Golden Company]] from [[Essos]] to fight for Cersei. She rebuffs an offer of drink from her uncle, before stating that he has picked the losing side. However, Euron arrogantly states that he will simply leave the Queen of the Andals should it come to that (but he will lay with her first)."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]" [[Theon rescues Yara from the ''Silence''.]] While Euron is distracted in the [[Red Keep]], with Cersei finally giving in to his lust following Jaime's departure, Theon and his remaining ironborn sneak aboard.

He awkwardly unties her before she hauls herself to her feet and knocks him to the ground with a headbutt, due to his earlier [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|abandonment of her]].

At Daenerys's war council on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], [[Varys]] confirms that Yara has [[Retaking of the Iron Islands|retaken]] the Iron Islands."[[The Last of the Starks]]" With Euron being slain by Jaime in the [[Battle of King's Landing]], Yara is the undisputed Queen of the Iron Islands and last living Greyjoy."[[The Bells]]"  After the [[assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassination of Daenerys]], Yara takes part in the trial of Jon. She tells the gathering to let the Unsullied decide his fate. Arya threatens to kill her if she demands killing Jon again. Davos, however, defuses the situation before it gets out of hand. Tyrion advises the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to choose a new King. When the gathering doesn't nominate anyone themselves, he recommends [[Bran Stark]] as the nominee. Yara joins the others in assenting to that proposal.
