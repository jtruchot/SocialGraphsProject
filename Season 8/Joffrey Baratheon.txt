= Following the [[Battle at Dragonstone]], in which Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s second dragon [[Rhaegal]] is killed, Tyrion and Varys argue in the throne room about whether Daenerys or [[Jon Snow]], whose claim is better than hers, would be a better King, as Varys feels Daenerys has slowly started to become more ruthless and paranoid and believes Jon, who shows no signs of succumbing to the [[Targaryen madness]] could be the better person to rule. When Varys mentions that Jon is a man and therefore more appealing to the lords of Westeros. Tyrion counters that Joffrey was a man as well, implying that him being a man did not make him less of a bad ruler."[[The Last of the Starks]]"  Joffrey's reign also proved to be one of the reasons why the hereditary monarchy was abolished, as Tyrion alludes to his reign as a case study, arguing to Sansa how cruel sons of kings could be."[[The Iron Throne]]"
