= When Jaime arrives at Winterfell shortly before the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], Daenerys remembers the stories that her brother Viserys would tell her about "the man who killed their father" and what they would do to him once they conquered the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys does not trust Jaime, but Sansa allows him to stay in Winterfell."[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"  The caches of wildfire, placed beneath King's Landing at Aerys's orders years ago, detonate during the [[Battle of King's Landing]] by dragonfire, unleashed by [[Drogon]] at Daenerys's command. During the battle, Aerys's killer is killed alongside his sister Cersei, crushed by debris under the Red Keep. In a way, Daenerys avenged her father's death, but also carried out his diabolic plan which Jaime prevented years ago."[[The Bells]]"  Ironically, Aerys's daughter suffers the same fate he did by being stabbed to death at the feet of the Iron Throne, and by his grandson no less. As Aerys's last child died, Jon Snow/Aegon Targaryen is the last known living member of House Targaryen."[[The Iron Throne]]"
