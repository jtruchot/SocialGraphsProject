= Led by the Night King, the White Walkers quickly advance south and attack [[Last Hearth]], [[Fall of Last Hearth|massacring]] the population and adding them to the army of the dead. [[Ned Umber]] is found pinned to a wall in the middle of severed arms arranged in a spiral, which [[Beric Dondarrion]] deduces is a message from the Night King himself."[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]" They burn the boy's corpse when it suddenly reanimates.   [[The Night King directs the Army of the Dead from atop Viserion.]] [[Winterfell]] prepares its defenses against the Night King. At a war council, [[Jon Snow]] suggests going after the Night King, referring to Beric Dondarrion's earlier plan during the [[Wight Hunt]]. [[Bran Stark]], as the new [[Three-Eyed Raven]], offers to use himself as bait to draw out the Night King and lure him into a trap. Bran explains that the Night King will come after him because he wants to "erase [the] [[Known world|world]], and the [Three-Eyed Raven] is its [[Greensight|memory]].""[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]" When the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]] begins, the Night King directs his forces from [[Viserion]] in the skies above Winterfell, his lieutenants placed along the outlying forest. During the battle, Bran wargs into several ravens to find him and lure him out of hiding.  [[Jon battles the Night King atop Rhaegal.]] After directing his wights to move through Winterfell's trenches, which were lit on fire in an attempt to prevent the army of the dead from advancing, the Night King engages in a fierce aerial duel with Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen on their own dragons, [[Rhaegal]] and [[Drogon]], respectively, pursuing Daenerys on Drogon with Viserion's blue flame. The Night King flies down and blasts a hole in Winterfell using Viserion by burning down some of its walls, but is suddenly attacked by Jon on Rhaegal, who fights with the dead Viserion.  [[The Night King smirks at Daenerys following her attempt to destroy him.]] Before the Night King can kill them both, Daenerys flies in on Drogon and knocks into Viserion. The Night King falls from his mount, landing hundreds of feet below. Circling back, Daenerys sees the Night King standing below. On her command Drogon blasts him with dragon fire, but when the flames clear, to her horror the Night King stands unscathed. Smirking, he hurls an ice spear at Drogon, but Daenerys flies off to avoid it. Meanwhile Rhaegal, injured from his fight with Viserion, collapses into the ground, and Jon Snow tumbles off of him.  [[right|The Night King reanimates Winterfell's dead.]] Jon charges at the Night King as he is walking towards the breached walls at Winterfell, but the Night King becomes aware of him, turns, and calmly raises his arms to resurrect the corpses littered around them as wights. The dead all around the castle rise as well, and a new wave of fresh wights surges toward the defenders within. Even those buried in Winterfell's crypts awake, smash through the walls and attack the non-combatants huddled there.  [[The Night King kills Theon.]] Jon, surrounded by fresh wights, is held off while the Night King continues to pursue his target: the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran Stark. The Night King enters the [[godswood]] of Winterfell alongside other White Walkers as the wights finish off the remaining ironborn defending Bran. [[Theon Greyjoy]] charges at the Night King, but the Night King stops Theon's charge, breaks his spear, and impales him, killing him. The Night King then walks up to the Three-Eyed Raven and glares at Bran as he begins to draw his ice blade to kill him.  [[right|Arya Stark kills the Night King.]] Suddenly, [[Arya Stark]] leaps at the Night King from behind with her [[Valyrian steel dagger]]. The Night King reacts in time, turning and grabbing her knife arm while seizing her by the throat with his other hand. But Arya has one more assassinâ€™s trick up her sleeve: she drops the dagger, catching it with her free hand and plunges it into the Night King's chest, causing him to explode into shards of ice. His death starts a chain reaction as the other White Walkers shatter in the same manner and all of the wights in the army of the dead and Viserion collapse to the ground, free of the curse that kept them reanimated.   The Night King's death marks the end of the Battle of Winterfell and the entire Great War with the living victorious. With the destruction of the Night King, the White Walkers become extinct, and the Long Night is forever prevented from returning."[[The Long Night]]"
