= After the [[Battle of King's Landing]] and the [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|death]] of Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]], Robin travels to King's Landing with Lord Royce. They participate in a [[Great Council of 305 AC|council]] made up of the heads of each remaining Great House, as well as other major players, to decide Jon's and Tyrion's fates. He, alongside other lords, shows awkwardness when [[Edmure Tully]] is told to sit after attempting to put his own name in for the new king, unable to look at him, potentially due to their relation. Robin appears to be capable on his own, paying attention throughout the meeting to whomever is speaking, though he does have a more lax stance about it than the other lords present.  He ultimately agrees with the other lords and ladies that his cousin [[Bran Stark]] should be the new [[King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men]]."[[The Iron Throne]]"
