 6]]=== [[Edd correctly guesses Thorne instigated Jon's murder.]] Alerted by [[Ghost]]'s whimpers, Edd finds Jon's body in Castle Black's courtyard along with [[Davos Seaworth]] and several of Jon's friends. They take Jon's body into his quarters for safekeeping. Edd quickly realizes from Jon's stab wounds that Thorne was likely behind the [[Mutiny at Castle Black|murder]]. On Davos's advice, Edd frees and brings in Ghost. Davos later starts to create a plan to take on Thorne. Knowing that they are outnumbered and need help from the people in debt to Jon, Edd leaves Castle Black, most likely to track down Tormund and bring him and the wildlings back to aid them. Edd instructs his fellow brothers to lock the door and not let anyone inside until he returns.  [[Thorne is taken to the cells on Edd's orders.]] Edd manages to locate Tormund and they lead the wildlings back to Castle Black just when the mutineers are on the verge of slaughtering Jon's loyalists. Wun Wun smashes the door down and Edd confronts Thorne, naming him and the mutineers as the true traitors for betraying their Lord Commander. After Thorne and [[Olly]] are restrained by wildlings, Edd orders the mutineers locked in the cells for their treachery. Edd leads Tormund to Jon's body, and is later present with Davos, Tormund, and Jon's friends when [[Melisandre]] attempts to [[Magic|revive]] Jon the same way [[Thoros]] revived [[Beric Dondarrion]] six times. When the ritual appears to fail, Edd leaves the room with the rest in disappointment, seconds before Jon awakens."[[Home]]"  [[Jon abdicates the position of Lord Commander to Edd.]] When Davos leads the resurrected Jon into the courtyard, Edd embraces his friend, again quipping that his eyes are not blue. Edd is later present at the hanging of the traitors led by Alliser Thorne. After the execution, Edd suggests that they burn the bodies. Jon hands his Night's Watch cloak over to Edd as Jon verbally gives him control of Castle Black. Thereafter, Edd becomes the acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."[[Oathbreaker]]"  While Jon packs his things, Edd chastises him for abandoning the Watch, since those who betrayed and murdered him have been dealt with, but Jon, still traumatized, refuses to listen. Edd reminds Jon that the Watch's vows are meant for life, to which Jon counters that he has already given his life. A horn sounds and Edd and Jon run outside to see Jon's sister, [[Sansa Stark]], arrive with [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Podrick Payne]]. He witnesses Jon and Sansa embrace after five years of separation."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  [[Edd listens to Ramsay's letter.]] Later, Edd eats with Jon, Sansa, Brienne, Podrick, and Tormund, apologizing to Sansa for the [[Food and drink|food]]'s poor quality in comparison to that of [[Winterfell]], and appearing slightly amused at Tormund's admiration for Brienne. Jon receives [[Bastard Letter|a letter]] from [[Ramsay Bolton]], and Edd listens as Jon and Sansa read it aloud, where Ramsay demands Sansa's return on threat of harming Jon and his friends. Edd shows visible signs of anger at Ramsay's threats.  [[180x180px|Edd and Jon say farewell to one another.]] Edd later attends a war council with Jon, Sansa, Davos, Brienne, Podrick, and Tormund, remaining silent while listening to Jon, Sansa, and Davos's plans for their [[Battle of the Bastards|upcoming battle]] with Ramsay. As they prepare to leave, Edd hugs Jon one last time, wishing him good luck. Jon jokingly asks Edd not to knock the Wall down while he's gone. Once they have left, a [[Night's Watch man (The Door)|brother]] asks Edd's permission to close the gate, addressing him as "Lord Commander". It takes Edd a few moments to remember that Jon named him acting Lord Commander, and he gives the order to "close the bloody gate"."[[The Door]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
