 6]]=== Black Walder and Lothar inform their father of the capture of [[Riverrun]] by Ser [[Brynden Tully]]. When Lord Walder berates them for allowing the Blackfish to escape in the first place, Black Walder begins to protest but his father cuts him off and demands they take back Riverrun. They argue that, since [[House Mallister]] and [[House Blackwood]] are supporting Brynden, and Riverrun is built to withstand sieges, retaking the castle would be impossible. Walder tells his bastard to take Riverrun by showing Brynden the knife he used to cut Catelyn's throat, and by using the captive Edmure as a bartering piece."[[Blood of My Blood]]" [[right|180x180px|Black Walder steps back from commanding the siege.]] Black Walder and Lothar siege Riverrun as commanded, but do a poor job of it. They do not fortify their boundaries, allow the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army to enter unnoticed, and do not even dig trenches. To try and force Brynden to surrender, Walder stands on a scaffold with Edmure and threatens to hang him. When this fails, he threatens to cut his throat as he did to Catelyn. Brynden calls his bluff, knowing that Edmure is too valuable to kill, and the siege continues. Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] arrives to take over from the Freys, but is immediately challenged by Walder. Jaime contemptfully calls Walder a fool for making threats he wasn't prepared to carry out and orders him to be silent. When Rivers keeps talking, Jaime hits him, and Walder begrudgingly follows his and Bronn's orders, although he is clearly unhappy."[[The Broken Man]]" [[left|180x180px|Walder is carved into a pie.]] Black Walder is seen at The Twins, where the Lannisters and the Freys celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is later killed by [[Arya Stark]], who minces his flesh and bakes him into [[Frey pie|a pie]] together with his brother, Lothar. She then serves the pie to their father, who eats at least one helping before Arya brings another and reveals what she had done, commenting that they were not easy to carve, especially Black Walder. Arya then reveals her identity to Lord Walder and slits his throat as Black Walder once did to her mother."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
