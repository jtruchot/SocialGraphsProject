 6]]=== The Night King appears in one of [[Bran Stark]]'s visions, where he witnesses him as a human being transformed into a White Walker by the [[Children of the Forest]], notably among them [[Leaf]]. She explains after his vision that they had to create the White Walkers as their defenders during the [[Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|war]] with the [[First Men]].  [[left|The Night King leaves his mark on Bran.]] Later, Bran makes the risky decision to experience a vision on his own, and finds himself looking at an army of wights and the Night King and other White Walkers at the back. Bran walks closer and is shocked to see that the Night King notices his presence. Bran wakes up screaming after the Night King suddenly appears right next to him and grabs his arm.  The [[Three-Eyed Raven]] says that the Night King touched him, which Bran confirms when a blue hand-mark is seen on his forearm. The Three-Eyed Raven says because of that mark, the Night King now knows exactly where they are, and the [[cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|cave]] cannot protect them any more.  [[right|The Night King assaults the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven with the army of the dead.]] The Night King and his army quickly travel to the cave, preceded by their aura of cold, a signal to the Children of the Forest and [[Meera Reed]]. The Children of the Forest prepare their scarce defenses outside of the cave, but are quickly [[Battle at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|overrun]] and they are forced to retreat back to the tunnels. The Night King sends his army of wights to attack the tunnels, and they kill most of the Children and [[Summer]], though Bran, [[Meera Reed]], and [[Hodor]] manage to escape the cavern through a back tunnel. [[White Walker (The Door)|One]] of the other White Walkers is killed by a [[dragonglass]]-tipped spear thrown by Meera.  [[The Night King confronts the Three-Eyed raven.]] The Night King enters the cavern, and glares at the [[Greensight|greenseeing]] Three-Eyed Raven, his natural arch-nemesis as the memory of the [[known world]], before he kills him with his falx. He then sends the rest of his wights to kill Leaf and eventually Hodor, who attempts to stop the wights from going further by sacrificing himself to hold the door. While Meera drags Bran through the snow, Bran sees visions of the Night King converting Craster's last son into a White Walker, leading a massive attack on Hardhome, and branding him with his mark.  In the aftermath of his [[Battle of the Bastards|victory]] at [[Winterfell]] and the confirmation from the [[Citadel]] that winter has come through white [[raven]]s, [[Jon Snow]] tells the gathered [[Lordship|lords]] of the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] who wish to return home following [[Ramsay Bolton]]'s defeat to prepare for winter. He warns that the [[Great War|war]] is not over after [[Cley Cerwyn]] suggests it is with the defeat of [[House Bolton]], alluding to the Night King as their ''true'' enemy, warning that the Night King won't wait out the winter storms, because he is the one who brings the storm."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
