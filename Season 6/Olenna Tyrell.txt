 6]]=== [[Olenna joins the small council, at the request of Kevan Lannister.]] Ser [[Kevan Lannister]], the new [[Hand of the King]], has invited Olenna to sit on the [[small council]] – which officially now consists of Kevan, [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], and Mace – at least to deal with the situation of Margaery and Loras's imprisonment. Barging into a Council meeting, Cersei expresses irritation that Olenna was invited while she was not, to which Olenna counters that Cersei is not the queen anymore – Margaery is, being married to the current king. Kevan refuses to deal with Cersei and, conceding that he can't force her to leave thanks to the reanimated [[Gregor Clegane]], has the Councilors, including Olenna, leave instead."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[Olenna is informed of the arrangements for Margaery's walk of atonement.]] At another "meeting" of the small council, Olenna and Kevan are surprised when Cersei and Jaime actually come to parlay. Cersei explains that she and Olenna played right into the High Sparrow's hands by continuing to squabble instead of presenting a united front, and now the High Sparrow is planning to have Margaery do the [[Walk of atonement]] just like she did. The Lannister twins explain their plan: Olenna will have Tyrell troops liberate Margaery and Loras, and turn them over to the Crown's Justice (in this case, Kevan), for a civil trial. Kevan, in turn, will keep royal and Lannister troops away from the incident, in keeping with Tommen's orders not to antagonize the Faith. Olenna doesn't think it's a particularly good plan, but agrees that at this point it's their only option, and if blood is spilled, better it be the Sparrows' and not theirs."[[Book of the Stranger]]" [[Olenna prepares for Margaery's atonement.]] Olenna accompanies Mace and his column of Tyrell troops to the Great Sept to watch the proceedings herself. She and Jaime exchange worried glances when they realize that the High Sparrow is up to something. As the High Sparrow announces there would be no Walk of Atonement for Margaery, Olenna signals to her son for the Tyrell Army to stand down. She moves closer to Jaime and Mace when Tommen appears and announces the new alliance between the Crown and the Faith. When Mace asks her what just happened, Olenna gruffly replies that they've been beaten."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  [[Olenna visits her granddaughter Margaery for the last time, under Unella's supervision.]] Following the alliance between the [[Iron Throne]] and the [[Faith Militant]] and the conversion of King [[Tommen Baratheon]] and Queen [[Margaery Tyrell]], Olenna meets with Margaery, pressuring her to turn away and stand against the Faith Militant. She reminds Margaery that they have her brother [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], though in the presence of [[Septa]] [[Unella]], Margaery says he must atone for his sins. Olenna is not impressed by the admittedly imposing septa, asking in a derogatory fashion if "it" speaks at all and threatens to have her men give her a good bashing. Before leaving with Unella, Margaery discretely slips Olenna a folded note. Realizing that Margaery might not actually be brainwashed, Olenna puts on a show but leaves quickly.  As soon as she is alone, she unfolds the note. It contains a drawing of a rose, the [[House Tyrell]] sigil, which leads Olenna to smile: Margaery is still a Tyrell at heart, and has wrapped the Sparrows around her finger. Later, Olenna is visited by [[Cersei Lannister]], who urges her to fight against the Faith Militant, but Olenna says that she is leaving for [[Highgarden]], before "that shoeless zealot" gets the idea to throw her in a cell as well. Trying to convince Olenna, Cersei tells her they have a common [[High Sparrow|enemy]], and that they should unite and defeat him. Olenna, however, reminds Cersei that the rise of the Faith Militant, the imprisonment of her grandchildren and the compromised future of both the Lannisters and the Tyrells are all due to Cersei's stupidity. Cersei tries to win Olenna over by comparing her love for Tommen with Olenna's love for her grandchildren, to which Olenna reminds her of the smug look she gave her when Loras and Margaery were dragged away by the Faith Militant, pondering that Cersei is possibly the worst person she has ever met. Olenna bluntly tells Cersei the truth of the matter: Cersei has no friends and is surrounded by enemies with absolutely no support. She then adds that her only joy comes from the fact that Cersei has truly lost."[[The Broken Man]]" [[Olenna converses with the Sand Snakes of Dorne.]] This joy is shattered, however, with the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|deaths]] of her [[Mace Tyrell|son]] and grandchildren, orchestrated by Cersei. Left as the sole ruler of House Tyrell, Olenna declares war on Cersei, and accepts an invitation to [[Dorne]] to meet with [[Ellaria Sand]]. Wreathed in black as a sign of mourning and quite clearly struggling to control her emotions at the loss of her beloved family, Olenna listens to Ellaria's offer of an alliance between Dorne and the Reach in the interest of survival. After making plain her disgust at Ellaria and the [[Sand Snakes]] for their [[Coup in Dorne|action]] to seize power in Dorne, Olenna flatly tells Ellaria that she no longer cares about survival. [[Varys cements a Tyrell-Targaryen alliance with Olenna.]] Ellaria alters her offer to "vengeance and justice", and summons someone from the shadows. Olenna turns to see [[Varys]], who clarifies the offer further: "[[House Targaryen|Fire and Blood]]." Some time later, the [[Redwyne Fleet|fleet]] of the [[Reach]] can be seen among the rest of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s fleet, as she begins her voyage home to Westeros, though it is not clarified if Lady Olenna is among Daenerys' retinue – she may have remained in the Reach to coordinate the Dragon Queen's arrival.
