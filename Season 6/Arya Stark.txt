 6]]=== [[Arya fights the Waif; blind.]] Now blind, Arya poses as a beggar as part of her training. After overhearing two passing citizens discussing Meryn's murder, she is approached by the [[Waif]], remarking on her blindness. Tossed a stick, she fights and loses another sparring match against the Waif. Unimpressed, the Waif leaves Arya, promising to return the following day."[[The Red Woman]]"  [[Arya rejoins the Faceless Men.]] The next day, the Waif returns and asks Arya who she is. When Arya answers "no one," the Waif brushes this off and promptly beats her in another sparring match. Arya angrily lashes out after the Waif leaves, but is stopped by Jaqen, who repeatedly asks her to say her name. After Arya tells him "a girl has no name" each time, an impressed Jaqen allows her to return to the House of Black and White."[[Home]]"  Multiple stick fights between Arya and the Waif ensue. At the same time, Arya learns to cope with her blindness while telling the Waif her story and list of targets. With Arya finally holding her own, Jaqen gives her a cup from the well in the House of Black and White and tells her if she truly is no one, she has nothing to fear. She drinks the water and regains her sight."[[Oathbreaker]]"  [[Jaqen gives Arya a target.]] Arya is tasked to kill an actress named [[Lady Crane]], though Jaqen warns she has been given a second chance and won't get a third. She views the first portion of the play ''[[The Bloody Hand]]'', in which Lady Crane portrays Cersei. Afterwards, Arya notices that another actress, [[Bianca]], is jealous of Lady Crane, and deduces that it was she who hired the Faceless Men to kill Lady Crane."[[The Door]]"  [[Arya watches ''The Bloody Hand''.]] After watching the remainder of the play on a different occasion, Arya walks backstage and poisons her Lady Crane's rum. On the way back, Lady Crane notices her, and the two briefly converse about the play. Speaking from experience, Arya suggests that the Cersei character's response to the death of her son would not only be grief -- it should also include anger. After asking Arya if she likes pretending to be others, Crane tries to express Arya's opinion to the rest of the troupe, but is quickly shut down. She goes to drink the beverage Arya poisoned, but Arya slaps it from her hands before she can drink it, blaming Bianca.  [[Arya retrieves Needle.]] Unbeknownst to Arya, The Waif had been following her and discovers that Arya has failed to kill the actress. The Waif proceeds to report Arya's failure to Jaqen, who grants her wish to let her kill Arya but that she must not let her suffer. Meanwhile, Arya retrieves [[Needle]] from its hiding place and prepares to defend herself, presumably abandoning the goal of becoming a Faceless assassin and knowing her failure has made her a target."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  [[Arya is stabbed by the Waif.]]Afterwards, Arya secures passage back to Westeros by bribing a [[Westerosi trader]]. However, she is attacked and repeatedly stabbed in the stomach by the Waif, and only barely escapes by jumping into the river. She is left stumbling through the streets of Braavos, critically wounded and extremely paranoid."[[The Broken Man]]"  [[Arya's wounds worsen whilst escaping the Waif.]] Seeking refuge, Arya finds her way to [[Lady Crane]], collapsing from her injuries behind the theater troupe stage. Lady Crane takes her to her living quarters, where she treats Arya's wounds and gives her a new set of clothing. Arya reluctantly accepts a dosage of [[milk of the poppy]] to help ease her pain, and soon after falls asleep in Lady Crane's bed. When she wakes up, she finds her dead in the next room, murdered by the Waif. Jumping off the balcony and into the streets of Braavos, Arya manages to escape, though she is pursued by the Waif. After scurrying the back-alleys of the city, Arya finds herself in the Braavosi market. However, the Waif continues to pursue her, forcing her to jump into the commotion of the crowd. Subsequently, Arya's stitches become undone.    [[Arya prepares to fight the Waif.]] Leaving a trail of blood in her wake, Arya lures the Waif to the hideout in which she has hidden Needle. The Waif then asks her if she would like to die on her knees, or on her feet - in response, Arya pulls Needle out from its hiding place and confronts her attacker, starting by putting out the only light in the room. In the ensuing fight, Arya manages to best the Waif due to her proficiency with fighting in blindness, a skill which was ironically taught and trained by the Waif. She kills her adversary and then removes her face, which she brings back to the Hall of Faces.   Aware that Jaqen sent the Waif to kill her, Arya points Needle at him in an accusatory manner, though Jaqen claims that she has finally truly become "no one", indicating the completion of her training as a Faceless Man. In reply, Arya reaffirms that she will never be "no one" and is and will always be Arya Stark of Winterfell. Lowering her sword, she then leaves the [[House of Black and White]] and Jaqen for good, making the ultimate decision to return to Westeros, her home."[[No One]]"  [[Arya reveals herself to Walder Frey and slits his throat.]] Upon arriving in Westeros, Arya travels to the Twins where she disguises herself as a serving girl. After Jaime and his soldiers depart for King's Landing, Arya manages to kill both "Lame" [[Lothar Frey]] and "Black" [[Walder Rivers]], who were responsible for the deaths of [[Talisa Stark]] and her mother [[Catelyn Stark]], respectively. She then proceeds to dismember their bodies and bake them into a [[Frey pie|pie]], which she serves to Lord [[Walder Frey]] as the two are alone in the dining hall, still wearing the face of a serving girl. After she reveals her true identity, she slits Walder's throat and watches with amusement as he dies."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
