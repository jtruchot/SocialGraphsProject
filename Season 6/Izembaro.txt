When he retires backstage, he says that he found the day's crowd particularly bad, and complains that they were "worse than animals". [[Lady Crane]] tries to suggest a change to the script, so he mocks her for trying to rise above her station, and claims she has no right to an opinion because he has been acting all his life. He watches in bemused shock as [[Arya Stark|Arya]] spills Crane's drink and accuses [[Bianca]] of wanting Crane dead."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  Izembaro later loses both Bianca, whose face has been mutilated by a vengeful Crane, and Lady Crane herself who has been killed by the [[Waif]].
