 6]]=== While visiting the Boltons at Winterfell, [[Harald Karstark]] assures them that House Stark lost his loyalty when Robb cut off his father's head. Moments later, Ramsay [[Assassination at Winterfell|kills Roose]] in a manner similar to the way the latter killed Robb - a knife to the heart.  Meanwhile, Theon decides to part ways with Sansa as she travels north to [[Castle Black]] to be reunited with her brother Jon Snow, entrusting Sansa's safety to [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Podrick Payne]]. Although Sansa assures Theon that she will vouch for him if he comes with them, Theon cites his betrayal of Robb as one of many reasons why he fears that Jon may still kill him."[[Home]]" When Jon and Sansa attempt to rally the support of [[House Glover]], Lord [[Robett Glover]] refuses, citing Robb's inability to protect the North from the [[ironborn]] because he had been distracted by a "[[Talisa Stark|foreign whore]]" and had gotten himself and all of his men killed."[[The Broken Man]]"  When Jaime and his forces are tasked with assisting House Frey in recapturing Riverrun from Ser [[Brynden Tully]], Jaime discusses the terms of surrender with the Blackfish who asks Jaime if he wishes to resume his captivity, having been Robb's prisoner for many months during the war. Jaime remarks that the war is over and to simply surrender to save his life and the lives of his men. Blackfish then replies that so long as he is still standing, the war is not over - implying he is continuing the fight not only to protect his ancestral home but also in honor of his slain family.  Jaime then attempts to reason with [[Edmure Tully]], who had been a Lannister-Frey prisoner in the years following the Red Wedding, to order his men to stand down and to open the gates to the castle. During their discussion, Edmure remarks that he does not understand how Jaime is able to live with himself due to all the horrible things he has done - namely playing a part in murdering his entire family and the conditions of his imprisonment over the past few years. Jaime explains to Edmure his admiration for his deceased sister Catelyn Stark and that he actually admired her far more then he admired Robb or Ned. Jaime eventually threatens to launch Edmure's infant son over the castle walls and the broken Edmure then agrees to order his men to surrender to the Lannister and Frey forces, resulting in the death of the Blackfish and the end of Tully control in the Riverlands - the final remnant of Robb's army. "[[No One]]"  Following the successful [[Second Siege of Riverrun]], Walder Frey invites Jaime and his forces to the [[Twins]] for a celebratory feast. During the party, Walder speaks with Jaime regarding his House's rise to power. Jaime points out that without the Lannisters, House Frey would have never risen to power like it did. Walder remarks he does not care about being mocked and that regardless of how it was accomplished, he had defeated House Tully and House Stark. Walder then questions Jaime's ability in combat and mentions that the last battle Jaime fought in, he had been defeated and captured by Robb. Walder then also remarks that it does not matter given that they are both victors and "Kingslayers", referring to his betrayal against Robb and Jaime's betrayal of [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. "[[The Winds of Winter]]"  Following the celebration for the [[Second Siege of Riverrun|recapture of Riverrun]], Arya avenges the deaths of Robb, Catelyn, and Talisa when she [[Assassinations at the Twins|assassinates Walder Frey and his sons, Black Walder and Lothar]]. During an assembly of Northern and Vale lords following the [[Battle of the Bastards|liberation of Winterfell]] and the extinction of House Bolton, after [[Lyanna Mormont]] hails Jon Snow as King, Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] takes the word and notes how he had refused to support Jon and Sansa to spare his [[House Manderly|house]] more losses; after admitting he was wrong, he hails Jon for avenging the Red Wedding and declares him the "White Wolf" and the new King in the North. Other northern lords, and then the entire assembly - except for Petyr Baelish - hail Jon as the new King in the North and Robb's successor.  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
