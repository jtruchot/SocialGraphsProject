= Olly is present in the dining room of Castle Black when Thorne announces Jon's murder at their hands and gives his justification to sway most of the Watch to his side. He witnesses Thorne issue Davos and the brothers loyal to Jon his ultimatum to surrender or die."[[The Red Woman]]" [[Olly attempts to defend Castle Black against the wildlings.]] Later, Olly is present as the mutineers attempt to break into the room where Jon's body is. Before they could break in, however, Edd returns with Tormund Giantsbane and an army of wildlings. Though Thorne demands that the watchmen stand and fight, they are intimidated into surrender by the giant, [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun|Wun Wun]]. Olly then charges Tormund (likely due to his involvement in the attack on Olly's village), but is quickly overpowered and disarmed.

As Jon asks his condemned murderers for their last words, Olly refuses to speak at his turn and instead glares furiously at Jon. After a moment of silence from Jon, Olly gives him one final look of hatred before he is hanged along with the others."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Although Olly literally stabbed him in the heart, Jon is plagued by guilt for executing him, as he was a boy even younger than Jon's "brother" [[Bran Stark|Bran]]."[[Book of the Stranger]]"
