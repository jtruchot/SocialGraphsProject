 6]]=== [[Daario and Jorah search for Dany.]] Daario and Jorah's search takes them to the Dothraki Sea. Daario gets Jorah to admit that he is in love with Daenerys, while musing that there is no escaping men like them in the world, and that he would like to see Westeros once Daenerys has conquered it. They eventually stumble across a circle of hoof prints with Daenerys' ring in the middle, leading them to discover that Daenerys has been taken by a Dothraki ''khalasar''."[[The Red Woman]]"  [[Daario and Jorah plan Dany's rescue.]] Daario and Jorah are climbing a hill in order to get a vantage point over [[Vaes Dothrak]], which is where their search for Daenerys has taken them. Daario continues to make fun of Jorah about how Daenerys chose Daario over him, which annoys Jorah. Upon reaching the top of the hill Jorah lays out a plan on how they are going to rescue Daenerys, a plan which involves sneaking into Vaes Dothrak during nighttime unarmed, because if they were to get caught with weapons they would be killed (because all weapons are forbidden inside Vaes Dothrak), but if they were unarmed they could pose as merchants. Daario doesn't like the idea of giving up his weapons, especially his dagger, and is very reluctant about it, but he eventually agrees to hand them over.  [[Jorah and Daario sneak into Vaes Dothrak.]] Just as he is about to hand over his dagger he notices the [[Greyscale]] on Jorah's wrist. Jorah assures Daario that it didn't touch him and that he is aware of the consequences it brings. Daario and Jorah then sneak in to the city during the night. They eventually stumble across two Dothraki warriors, [[Aggo (The Red Woman)|Aggo]] and [[Iggo]], in a back alley. Jorah tries to convince the two Dothraki that they are merchants whom have gotten lost in the city, but Aggo doesn't believe their story and orders the other Dothraki to alert the city. Daario chases after Iggo while Jorah tries to fight Aggo.  [[Daario saves Jorah from Aggo.]] Daario catches up with Iggo and breaks his neck before he can alert the others. Due to Jorah's greyscale condition he is unable to hold his own against Aggo and is nearly killed right before Daario arrives to the rescue by stabbing Aggo in the back with his dagger that he had lied about leaving behind. Daario then attempts to cover up the stab-wound by smashing Aggo's body with a rock, making it look like he was smashed to death and not stabbed. Although Aggo's body is later discovered by members of the [[khalar vezhven]], [[Moro]] quickly dismisses any cause for conflict.  [[Daario and Jorah restrain Ornela.]] As Daenerys and another Dothraki widow, [[Ornela]], exit the Temple of the [[dosh khaleen]] to get some air they run into Daario and Jorah. Daario seizes Ornela and is about to kill her, but Daenerys makes him stand down. Jorah urges them to leave quickly before the bodies of Aggo and the other Dothraki are discovered. Daenerys, however, has another idea which involves [[Massacre of the khalar vezhven|burning]] down the temple where all the [[khal]]s will be meeting to decide Daenerys' fate, which would prove her power over the Dothraki in the process.  [[Daario watches in awe as Daenerys emerges from the temple.]] Daenerys enters the temple and after threatening the khals that they will be killed if they don't submit to her, she pushes down all the pyres inside causing the building to set fire. Khal [[Moro]] attempts to flee out the back door but is unable to because it has been sealed from the outside and its guards have been killed by Daario and Jorah. Daario, Jorah and all the other Dothraki witness as Daenerys steps out of the burning temple alive. The Dothraki all bow to her, followed by Jorah, and Daario, who still is in shock of what he just witnessed, bows last - awed by the extent of Daenerys's dominance."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  [[Daario observes Jorah as he confesses his love for Daenerys.]] The morning after the burning of the temple, Daario is present with Daenerys when she confronts Jorah about his recent actions. Daenerys forgives Jorah and welcomes him back to her service, but Jorah refuses her offer and rather tells her to send him away again. Jorah then goes on to show Daenerys his Greyscale infection and confess his love for, which seems to make Daario not jealous but rather sad for Jorah instead, knowing he most likely will die. Instead of sending Jorah away to die, she commands him to look for "the cure" to his infection so that he can come back to her.  [[Daario and Dany discuss her conquest.]] As Jorah departs into the unknown, Daario and Daenerys, along with the Dothraki, start making their way back to Meereen."[[The Door]]" On their way back to Meereen, Daenerys questions Daario on how many ships she will need to take [[Westeros]], to which Daario responds that in order to bring all the Dothraki and their horses, the Unsullied and the Second Sons, they would need a thousand ships if not more. Daario goes on to tell Daenerys that she isn't a ruler but rather a conqueror instead as her political rule in Meereen has proven. However, Daenerys simply states that she simply takes what belongs to her.  [[Daario watches as Daenerys inspires the ''Khalasar''.]] Daenerys suddenly orders Daario and the ''Khalasar'' to stop, and she rides off for unknown reasons. After a long while, Daario announces to the ''khalasar'' that he is going after her. As he is about to leave to search for Daenerys, they hear Drogon approaching, with Daenerys on his back. Landing before her extensive horde, she reveals her true intentions to the ''khalasar'' and Daario, who looks at her with satisfaction and admiration as she promises to lead her people to victory if they stand beside her in the conquest."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  [[Daario charges Daenerys' khalasar.]] Daario leads the Dothraki in their charge towards the gates of Meereen to end the [[Second Siege of Meereen|masters' siege]], removing the head of the first Son of the Harpy he encounters."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]" Following the battle, Daario is summoned by his queen. As Daenerys leaves for Westeros she breaks her ties with Daario at Tyrion's prompting, fearing that bringing a lover to Westeros would be a detriment to her cause. Daario recognizes Tyrion's influence and asks to go with Daenerys, revealing that he has truly grown to love her, but she refuses him. Daario and the Second Sons are left in Meereen to keep the peace while a provisional government transfers power to the people."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
