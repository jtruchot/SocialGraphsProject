 6]]=== [[Baelish convinces Robin Arryn to join the fray.]] Baelish returns to [[Runestone]] and greets Robin Arryn and Yohn Royce. Yohn quickly voices his suspicion of Baelish's involvement in Sansa's marriage to Ramsay Bolton since Baelish had told Yohn that Sansa was going to the Fingers with him. With the intention of manipulating Robin, Baelish responds by falsely claiming the Boltons ambushed Sansa and Baelish on the way to the Fingers and insinuates that Yohn leaked the information to the Boltons. Robin suggests having Yohn thrown through the Moon Door for this false treason but asks for Baelish's advice on what to do with Yohn. Baelish responds that if Yohn can ensure his loyalty to Robin Arryn, which Yohn quickly gives, that Yohn should be given a final chance. Baelish then immediately follows-up and tells Robin that he has learned that Sansa has fled Winterfell and will likely head to her half-brother Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]] at Castle Black for protection, though the Boltons will pursue her. Robin responds that since Sansa is his cousin, he should help her. Baelish takes his cue and orders Yohn to gather the knights of the Vale to rescue Sansa from the Boltons. This brings an end to the neutrality of House Arryn, which until then had steered clear of the [[War of the Five Kings]]."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  [[Petyr tells Sansa about Brynden's victory at Riverrun.]] Later, Baelish sends a letter to Sansa at Castle Black asking to meet in [[Mole's Town]]. Sansa travels to Mole's Town with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and confronts Baelish about her marriage to Ramsay, coldly asking if he knew the truth about Ramsay's sadistic side all along or if he was unaware and therefore, just stupid. Baelish responds that he made a mistake "trusting a [[Ramsay Bolton|stranger]]" and apologizes profusely, horrified at what Ramsay did, but has rallied the knights of the Vale to her cause and that the army is encamped at [[Moat Cailin]]. Sansa refuses his offer, saying that Baelish cannot help her - that he cannot even help himself if she orders Brienne to strike him down. She tells him that she already has her brother Jon's help and they will rally other Northern houses to their cause. She finishes by warning him never to speak to her again. Baelish, as he prepares to leave, tells Sansa of her great-uncle [[Brynden Tully]]'s success in recapturing [[Riverrun]] and suggests reaching out to him for support. Before he leaves, he reminds Sansa of Jon's [[bastardy]].  [[Baelish arrives with the Knights of the Vale.]] When failing to rally enough houses to their side, Sansa secretly writes Baelish to take him up on the offer she previously rejected."[[The Broken Man]]" Baelish arrives with the Vale Knights of [[House Arryn]] just when the Stark force is about to be massacred in the [[Battle of the Bastards]], and the Vale forces easily wipe out what remains of the [[House Bolton|Bolton]] army. Baelish is present when Wun Wun smashes down the door to Winterfell and witnesses Jon defeat Ramsay in combat. House Stark is subsequently restored as Lords of Winterfell and Ramsay is executed."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  [[Littlefinger tells Sansa of his intentions to sit on the Iron Throne, with her as his queen.]] In the battle's aftermath, Baelish approaches Sansa in the Godswood and finally admits that his goal is to sit on the Iron Throne with Sansa as his queen. Despite Baelish having declared for House Stark, Sansa refuses to trust him, due to Baelish's tendency to betray those he declares for his own well-being. Upon Sansa's refusal of him, Baelish attempts to convince Sansa that she should rule the North, calling Jon a "motherless bastard." Baelish is later present at the meeting where Jon is proclaimed the new King in the North by the Northern lords along with the Vale lords. Baelish is the only one who does not cheer, and instead stares at Sansa."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
