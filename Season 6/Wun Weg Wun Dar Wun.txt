= Wun Wun and Tormund lead the free folk in an attack on Castle Black, this time to save Jon's body and his few loyalists from the mutineers. Wun Wun breaks down the gates and intimidates the brothers into quickly surrendering, only killing one black brother after he foolishly (and futilely) shoots the giant in the back with a crossbow. After Tormund orders the brothers to stand down, Wun Wun witnesses Ser [[Alliser Thorne|Alliser]] and [[Olly]] being taken into custody for their role in the mutiny and the murder of Jon Snow.[[Home]] When Jon, Sansa and Tormund attempt to recruit the wildlings, Wun Wun is present and is the first to cast his vote by saying 'Snow'."[[The Broken Man]]"  [[Wun Wun awaits the coming battle.]] Wun Wun is on the front lines of Jon's army fighting against Ramsay Bolton and his forces at Winterfell. During the battle, after Jon's cavalry enters the fight and Ramsay's archers stop, Davos leads Wun Wun and his archers in a charge, as they cannot fire from their current position without hitting their own men. Wun Wun fights until they are surrounded by [[Smalljon Umber]] and the Bolton army.  [[Wun Wun participates in the Battle of the Bastards.]] Wun Wun uses his colossal strength to try and tear through the infantry line, but despite making a few noteworthy kills, he is outmatched by the rows of enemy pikes. He appears significantly weakened by his injuries. However, [[Petyr Baelish]] arrives with the Knights of the Vale, his aid having been finally accepted by Sansa. Ramsay's forces are decimated by the Vale cavalry and he retreats to Winterfell, reassuring his men that the opposing army lacks the resources to lay siege. Moments later, being in the vanguard to reach Winterfell, Wun Wun uses the last of his strength to breach the fortress's wooden doors with his bare hands, and then is riddled with arrows by the few remaining Bolton archers.  [[180x180px|Wun Wun, moments before his death.]] At that point, the Starks and Arryns reach Winterfell and proceed to clear out the remaining Boltons. Wun Wun falls to his knees, bloodied, injured and exhausted from the battle, as yet more bolts and arrows are fired into him. As he looks at Jon, who reaches out to him, he is shot in the eye by [[Ramsay Bolton]], killing him, as Jon and Tormund watch helplessly. Enraged, Jon furiously beats Ramsay to a pulp but stops after noticing Sansa standing over them. Wun Wun is avenged when Ramsay is taken prisoner, and after a barbed exchange with Sansa, he is fed to his own starving [[Bastard's girls|hounds]]."[[Battle of the Bastards]]"  It is currently unknown if Wun Wun was the last of his kind, or if giants still exist somewhere beyond the Wall.
