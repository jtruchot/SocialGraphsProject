= Eventually, the Unsullied find and apprehend Vala. She is brought before [[Varys]] in the [[Great Pyramid]], who interrogates her for information on the Sons of the Harpy. It seems that Vala became a prostitute to get close to Unsullied and Second Sons on the Sons of the Harpy's behalf, expressing vehement hatred for Daenerys and her soldiers, whom she sees as destroying Meereen. She initially refuses Varys, believing that the eunuch wishes to torture her, though he assures her this is not the case and will only lead to misinformation from her. Instead, Varys calmly backs her into a corner with knowledge of her young son, [[Dom]], and how bad his life must be if he loses his mother. When the Spider promises safe passage to [[Pentos]] for Vala and her son, as well as a generous bag of silver to buy a new life, she agrees to cooperate. She tells him that the masters of [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Volantis]] fund the Sons of the Harpy."[[Oathbreaker]]"
