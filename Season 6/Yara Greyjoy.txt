 6]]=== At [[Pyke]], Yara informs her father that the [[House Glover|Glovers]] have retaken [[Deepwood Motte]] and executed the ironborn garrison stationed there. With the loss of Deepwood Motte, the last major ironborn fortress in the [[North]], Yara reasons that the ironborn invasion of the North is a doomed cause. [[Yara confronts Balon on House Greyjoy's future.]] When Balon insists on continuing the fight, Yara argues that while the ironborn are unparalleled in naval warfare, they fare poorly on land, especially against a much larger mainland host. During their conversation, Balon chastises his daughter for wasting men on trying to rescue Theon from the [[Dreadfort]]. Yara refuses to apologize for her rescue attempt but tries to convince her father to end their rebellion against the mainland."[[Home]]" She points out that they were only able to take the strongholds in the North because the Northern lords were fighting a [[War of the Five Kings|war]] in the South. Now that the war is over, the Northerners are taking back their strongholds from the ironborn. Yara then reminds her father that the last time they [[Greyjoy Rebellion|pushed]] the Northerners too far, they were defeated and she lost her two older brothers. Balon angrily responds that he lost three sons that day and warns Yara that he will replace her with another heir if she does not obey. The two part company and Balon is subsequently murdered by his estranged brother [[Euron Greyjoy]]. [[Yara and Aeron discuss the upcoming Kingsmoot at her father's funeral.]] Balon's body is discovered after the storm and the following day Yara attends his seaside [[Funeral|funeral]], overseen by her uncle [[Aeron Greyjoy]], a [[Drowned Men|Drowned Man]]. Following the funeral, she vows to avenge her father's death by finding whoever is responsible and feeding them to the sharks while they're still alive. When Yara announces her intention to succeed her father on the [[Salt Throne]], Aeron reminds his niece that the [[Kingsmoot]] chooses the next ruler. While Balon wanted his daughter to succeed him, Aeron firmly points out that Balon did not make the rules. Aeron says that perhaps she will win and become the first woman in history to rule the Iron Islands but then again, perhaps not. [[Yara is reunited with Theon.]] Theon arrives at the Iron Islands and receives a harsh reception from Yara, who is still angry with him for refusing to be rescued from the Dreadfort, saying good men were lost that night. Weeping, he apologizes several times, but she doesn't want to hear it. She accuses him of trying to take advantage of their father's murder to become King of Pyke. Theon vehemently denies this, saying he had no idea Balon was dead until he arrived. She demands to know what he wants, and he says she deserves to be the ruler of Pyke and he will support her claim to the Salt Throne."[[Book of the Stranger]] [[Theon presses Yara's claim.]] At the [[Kingsmoot]], Yara is the first to claim the Salt Throne. She initially gains the support of those gathered, citing her experience leading the ironborn and as a sea warrior. However, one [[Ironborn 1 (The Door)|man]] does not support her claim due to her gender and Theon's return. This remark prompts Theon to speak about Yara's bravery and legitimacy to rule. His speech convinces most of the ironborn, but just as the Kingsmoot is about to close, Euron arrives.  [[Yara and Theon flee the Iron Islands.]] He lays claim, and Yara accuses him of murdering Balon. Euron admits his kinslaying but successfully convinces the ironborn that their former king was holding them back from greatness. Euron wins the Kingsmoot by proposing to marry [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and help her exact brutal vengeance on the mainland. While he is being baptized as the new ruler, Yara and Theon, realizing that he will kill them immediately, gather those loyal to them and escape with the majority of the [[Iron Fleet]]."[[The Door]]" [[Yara takes advantage of her presence in Volantis.]] Yara and Theon take the Iron Fleet to [[Essos]] where they stop over the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Volantis]] for rest and relaxation. The ironborn frequent a brothel on the [[Long Bridge]] where they are entertained by prostitutes. Yara takes a liking to one of them and they embrace. However, Theon is still traumatized by his ordeal with Ramsay and is still guilt-ridden over his role in the deaths of the orphan boys. Yara counsels him to regain his former confidence over a bottle of ale. She tells him that they plan to beat Euron in reaching Daenerys first, regain the Iron Islands and exact revenge against Euron. As Theon finally regains some of his swagger, she leaves to have sex with a [[Volantene whore 1|prostitute]]."[[The Broken Man]]"  In the aftermath of the failed [[Second Siege of Meereen|siege on]] [[Meereen]], Yara and Theon arrive with their hundred ships, seeking to negotiate a deal with the newly victorious Daenerys. They offer the Mother of Dragons their fleet of ships in exchange for her support of Yara's claim as the rightful [[King of the Iron Islands|Queen of the Iron Islands]] against Euron's claim. Tyrion is wary of Theon given what he saw of him at Winterfell and his crimes against the Starks; however, Theon and Yara insist that he has paid for what he has done. In the end, Daenerys, Tyrion, Yara, and Theon find common ground in their hatred of their [[Aerys II Targaryen|cruel]] and [[Tywin Lannister|merciless]] [[Balon Greyjoy|fathers]] and their desire for a better world than the one they were born into.  [[Yara and Daenerys make a pact.]] Yara manages to convince Daenerys not to trust Euron, with Theon pointing out that if Euron has no qualms about killing his own family, he'd have no problem with killing Daenerys after marrying her to gain control of all of Westeros. Daenerys finds Yara's terms reasonable (particularly since Yara's offer of alliance is far less matrimonial), and accepts the aid of her one hundred ships, although with the condition that the [[ironborn]] stop their raping and piracy of the mainland, which Yara reluctantly accepts. "[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  Some time later, Yara and Theon begin the voyage back to [[Westeros]], with the [[Iron Fleet]] forming part of Daenerys Targaryen's massive invasion force.
