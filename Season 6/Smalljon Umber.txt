 6]]=== [[180x180px|Smalljon hands Osha and Rickon over to Ramsay.]] Smalljon Umber travels to Winterfell to treat with Ramsay, requesting aid to fight the wildlings that have been let into the [[North]] by Jon. Ramsay questions his motives since the Umbers are famously loyal to [[House Stark]], but Smalljon counters that [[House Karstark]] has Stark blood, yet [[Harald Karstark]] is Ramsay's new lieutenant. Smalljon calls [[Roose Bolton|Ramsay's father]] a cunt; when Ramsay attempts to praise Roose, he interrupts him, again calling him a cunt and correctly accuses Ramsay of [[Assassination at Winterfell|murdering]] him, despite Ramsay's persistent claim that Roose was poisoned by his enemies.  Smalljon reveals that Jon has let a wildling army south of the Wall, which is bad news for the Umbers, as Last Hearth is further north than any other castle, and it is always the Umbers who are forced to fight the wildlings first. Smalljon freely admits that he enjoys the task, but this time, there are too many wildlings. Smalljon requests Ramsay's help, unaware that Jon actually let the wildlings through the Wall merely to keep them from falling into the hands of the coming [[White Walkers]]. Smalljon refuses to swear fealty to Ramsay, or even [[Bending the knee|kneel]]. Instead, he presents Ramsay with the captives Osha and Rickon Stark. When Ramsay asks Smalljon for proof of the boy's identity, he provides the severed head of Rickon's [[direwolf]], [[Shaggydog]]."[[Oathbreaker]]"  When news of Smalljon's betrayal reaches [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at [[Castle Black]], she declares that the Umbers "can hang"."[[The Door]]" [[180x180px|Smalljon leads the Umber forces into battle.]] Smalljon, Ramsay, and Harald attend a parley with Jon, Sansa, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], and [[Tormund]] offering terms for surrender. When Sansa asks for proof that Ramsay has Rickon, Smalljon tosses Shaggydog's head onto the ground, visibly angering Jon and Sansa. He and his soldiers later take part in the [[Battle of the Bastards]], where he watches as Ramsay leads a leashed Rickon onto the battlefield and cajoles the frightened boy to run before murdering him with an arrow. Smalljon leads the Bolton spearmen who form a wall around the Stark army. After the Stark army is surrounded by the spearmen, Smalljon climbs the wall of bodies to fight in the circle, beginning by slaying an injured wildling who was attempting to escape. He fights his way to Jon, but is swept away by the crowd before they can fight.  [[180x180px|Smalljon is killed by Tormund.]] He then comes face to face with Tormund, who he beats into submission with his fists and his own head, despite becoming trapped and crushed within the Stark army. Before he can finish Tormund, he is momentarily distracted by the arrival of the knights of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], giving Tormund enough time to bite into his neck, tear out part of his throat and sever his carotid artery, causing massive bleeding. Tormund subsequently stabs Smalljon to death, and his body is presumably burned after the battle on Jon's orders to prevent him returning as a wight."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
