 6]]=== [[Using Greensight, Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven visit Winterfell in the past.]] Bran continues his training under the Three-Eyed Raven. He and the raven watch a vision of his late father Ned and his uncle [[Benjen Stark]] as young boys training in the grounds of Winterfell by a young Rodrik Cassel. Bran also witnesses his late aunt [[Lyanna Stark]] as a young girl and a much younger Hodor. Through the vision, Bran learns that Hodor used to be a stable boy named "Wylis" before he became simpleton, who is carefully protected from harm by a middle-aged Old Nan. While Bran longs to stay in the vision, he is pulled out by the Three-Eyed Raven, who warns him that he may become too enamored with the past to want to return to reality. Bran finds Meera outside the [[Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|cave]], viewing the world beyond; still grieving over the loss of Jojen. Meera tells Bran that she was having trouble coping with their apparent inaction to the coming war. In response, Bran reminds her that it is no longer safe anywhere outside, to which Meera continues to spurn him. After Bran leaves, Leaf tells Meera of her importance to Bran's future."[[Home]]"  In another vision, Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven view the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|events that unfolded]] at the [[Tower of Joy]] towards the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Ned Stark rides to the Tower of Joy with five of his bannermen, one of them being [[Howland Reed]], to find Lyanna Stark. The tower is guarded by two Kingsguard: Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] and [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Gerold Hightower]]. After the two refuse Ned's requests to learn his sister's fate, the eight men duel. While Gerold Hightower is killed early on, Arthur Dayne single-handedly defeats nearly all of Ned's retainers, and is about to kill Ned himself when Howland Reed unexpectedly stabs Dayne through the back of the neck, having been injured early on, but not killed. Bran is shocked that the stories he heard were not as honorable as the events that actually unfolded. Ned finishes off Dayne by partially decapitating him with his own sword, [[Dawn]], and hears a woman scream from the tower. As Ned runs into the tower to find Lyanna, Bran calls out to him. Ned stops to look around, but is confused because he cannot find the source of the voice. Before Bran can discover what is in the tower for himself, the Three-Eyed Raven brings both of them out of the past. While he acknowledges that the younger Ned had heard Bran, he also warns Bran not to interfere with the past."[[Oathbreaker]]"  [[Bran discovers the origins of the White Walkers.]] In another vision of the past, thousands of years ago, Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven witness several Children of the Forest, including [[Leaf]], create the [[Night King|first White Walker]]. Once out of the vision and shocked at the revelation, Bran asks Leaf why they did it, and Leaf confesses it was to prevent the [[First Men]] from destroying more of their sacred [[weirwood]] trees and the extinction of their people during the [[Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|Wars]] which endangered the Children. She then reminds Bran that it was his ancestral culture with inevitably made this a necessary action."[[The Door]]"  [[Bran encounters the Night King during a vision - who sees and grabs him.]] Bran, without the consent of the Raven, connects to the weirwood with [[greensight]], and sees an army of wights and White Walkers. The Night King, who is present, intercepts his vision by touching him. The Three-Eyed Raven informs Bran that the Night King now has knowledge of their location and the cave's magic won’t prevent the white walkers or wights from entering due to the mark placed on Bran’s arm."[[The Door]]"  [[Bran explores Winterfell's past whilst the Night King attacks the cave.]] The [[Night King]] arrives with three other white walkers and an army of [[wight]]s outside the cave, while Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven are in a vision of the past of his father’s departure from Winterfell to the Vale. Meera tries to awaken Bran, and wights dig into the cave and a White Walker enters. Meera kills the White Walker with a [[dragonglass]] tipped spear and several of The Children die fighting. The Three-Eyed Raven advises Bran to listen to Meera’s voice, pleading to [[warg]] into Hodor, which now echoes in their vision. Bran sees a young Wylis and wargs into him, resulting in Bran warging into present-day Hodor as well. Hodor, under Bran's control, assists them in their escape out the cave. Summer stays to defend them against the wights, and is stabbed to death. The Night King then enters the cave and kills The Three Eyed Raven, causing him to disintegrate in the vision with Bran. Leaf sacrifices herself to halt the wights advancing toward Meera, Bran, and Hodor. Hodor, still controlled by Bran, and creates their escape. Hodor, now himself, held the door to hold the wights from killing everyone, and was slowly being overwhelmed. Meera carries Bran’s unconscious body away into the Northern winter. Desperate and scared, she screams "Hold the Door." Still in the vision of the past of Winterfell Bran sees young Wylis/Hodor collapse after his mind returns to his body. Young Wylis keeps screaming "hold the door" repeatedly until it slurs into "Hodor": Bran’s [[warg|possession]] of young Wylis in his [[greensight|vision]] of the past breaks young Wylis’s mind and he hears the echoes of Meera’s screams, which made his mind simple and only capable of repeating a form of the last words he heard before his death, "Hodor." Bran can only look on remorsefully as he realizes what he has done to Wylis/Hodor."[[The Door]]"  [[Benjen makes himself known to Bran.]] Meera drags Bran through the woods beyond the wall, while he is still caught in visions about past and future events. They are chased by wights and just when they are about to kill them, a hooded person arrives and is able to kill all the wights, using a flaming chain. He urges Bran and Meera to come with him. Later, when they make camp, their rescuer reveals himself, and to Bran's surprise, it is his presumed to have been dead uncle Benjen. He explains that he was stabbed by a White Walker and left to die, but the Children of the Forest rescued and stopped him from becoming a Wight. He says that Bran must now be the new Three-Eyed Raven, and that he shall be waiting for the White Walkers when they come to the realms of men."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  [[Bran and Meera head to the Wall.]] Benjen takes Bran and Meera to a [[Weirwood]] beyond the wall, and explains that he cannot pass due to magic used during the building of the Wall to make sure [[Wight|the dead]] can't go beyond it. He then rides off, leaving Bran and Meera alone by the weirwood. Bran sees the weirwood, and begins to crawl over to it. Meera asks him if he is ready, and he replies that he is now the Three-Eyed Raven - he has to be ready. He then places his hand on the tree and returns to his vision in the Tower of Joy. Following his father inside, he watches Ned find Lyanna in a bed of her own blood. She whispers to him and reveals she has just given birth to a newborn son, imploring Ned to protect him from Robert Baratheon. As Ned takes his infant nephew in his arms, Bran looks on and gulps, realizing the baby is his "half-brother" Jon."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
