 6]]=== [[180x180px|Qyburn tempts the Little Birds.]] In his laboratory, Qyburn continues to serve as Master of Whisperers by bribing a group of [[Varys]]'s little birds into his service with boxes of sweets. When Jaime and Cersei arrive accompanied by Gregor Clegane, the children are unnerved by the Mountain, though Qyburn promises them Clegane is a friend. As part of her revenge, Cersei asks Qyburn to bribe more of Varys's spies stationed in the other kingdoms, and he agrees to do so."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Qyburn enters Cersei's chamber to inform her that the [[Faith Militant]] have entered the Red Keep. Accompanied by Qyburn and the Mountain, Cersei confronts the group. Lancel says she must be taken to the High Sparrow, however Cersei disregards what her cousin is saying. Qyburn then watches as Gregor kills one of the sparrows."[[No One]]" [[Qyburn accompanies Cersei to Tommen's announcement. ]] Later, Cersei, Qyburn, and Ser Gregor enter the [[Great Hall]] to find a large crowd gathered for a royal announcement, King Tommen then announces that Cersei and [[Loras Tyrell]]'s trial will be held in the [[sept]] of Baelor on the first day of the [[Festival of the Mother]], and then declares that [[trial by combat]] is now forbidden. After the announcement Qyburn tells a shocked Cersei, who had been planning on calling a trial by combat with Gregor as her champion, that his little birds have been investigating an old rumor that she had told him about, and that the rumor was found to be much more than a rumor."[[No One]]" The rumor turns out to be the [[wildfire plot]], in which King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]] stored caches of wildfire across the city, including underneath the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Qyburn has his spies create leaks in the barrels containing the wildfire, then has them place candles in the middle of the resulting puddles, which slowly burn towards the wildfire."[[The Winds of Winter]]" [[Qyburn aids Cersei in killing Maester Pycelle.]] The wildfire ignites and [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroys]] the Sept of Baelor, killing the [[High Sparrow]], [[Mace Tyrell]], Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], [[Loras Tyrell]], [[Kevan Lannister]], and many others. Qyburn also has [[Pycelle]] assassinated by his spies so as to consolidate Cersei's power. For his service and loyalty, Qyburn is made Cersei's Hand, and later crowns her as Queen of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
