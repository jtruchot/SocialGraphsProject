 6]] === [[180x180px|Tyene kills Areo during Ellaria's coup.]] Areo escorts Prince Doran, along with Ellaria and Tyene to the Water Gardens, assuming a guard posting upon arrival. He watches silently as the prince and paramour exchange compliments and talk of how Oberyn and Doran were well suited for their respective lives. Soon after, Maester [[Caleotte]] appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Myrcella's death by [[Long farewell|poison]], which Doran immediately realizes was Ellaria's doing. Before Doran has a chance to react, Tyene stabs and poisons Areo in the spine, killing him instantly in order to leave Doran vulnerable for Ellaria to stab and kill him. From Doran's personal guard, Areo is the only one who is killed in Ellaria's [[Coup in Dorne|coup]], possibly because of his unquestionable loyalty to Doran, while the remaining guards stand and watch Doran bleed to death."[[The Red Woman]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
