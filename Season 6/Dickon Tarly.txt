Later at dinner, he is cordial but cool towards Sam and Gilly. When Sam asks him whether they're eating the deer that he and their father hunted, Dickon replies that what they're eating was in fact last week's haul, and that they did not have time to cure today's catch. He also engages in dinner table conversation with Sam about hunting beyond the Wall. Sam tells him that there are no deer and elks to hunt, only rabbits."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  After Gilly tells the hosts that Sam killed a [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|White Walker]], Dickon expresses amused disbelief and claims that [[White Walkers]] are just a myth. He is present when Randyll tells Sam that he will find work for Gilly as a servant and foster Little Sam as his grandson, but that Samwell is no longer welcome at Horn Hill.
