 6]]=== [[180x180px|Robett rejects Jon and Sansa.]] [[Jon Snow]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], and [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] secretly meet with Robett to try and gain his support against [[House Bolton]]. He refuses to help, as they have only secured the loyalty of [[House Mormont]], and citing that Jon has joined forces with [[Free Folk|wildlings]], whereas the Boltons helped Robett take Deepwood Motte back from the [[ironborn]], who had captured it and terrorized Robett's family and subjects (as well as noting that [[Ramsay Bolton]] might well kill him if he learns of Robett's meeting with the Starks).  [[Robett accosts Sansa on her late brother's marriage.]] He lambastes [[Robb Stark|Robb]], to whom House Glover was sworn, for giving no such help (to Robb's credit, this was his original intention, but he was persuaded otherwise by [[Roose Bolton]] - of course, that does not clear Robb of responsibility for failing to protect his subjects) and "taking up with a [[Talisa Stark|foreign whore]]", ruining his political alliances, thus costing the North the entire war and getting all of his men killed along with him at the [[Red Wedding]]. Despite the protestations of Jon and Sansa, Robett refuses to declare for them, and sends them away empty-handed."[[The Broken Man]]"  [[Robett declares Jon King in the North.]]Robett, along with other Northern lords, travels to [[Winterfell]] following the defeat of the Boltons at the [[Battle of the Bastards]], where he and two other lords, [[Wyman Manderly]] and [[Cley Cerwyn]], are berated by [[Lyanna Mormont]] for refusing to help the Stark cause. Robett is the second lord, after Lord Wyman, to declare Jon [[King in the North]]. He apologizes for not participating in the battle, and pledges his allegiance to House Stark and Jon."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
