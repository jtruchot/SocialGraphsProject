= [[Yezzan, Razdal and Belicho negotiate with Tyrion.]] At the diplomatic negotiations with Tyrion in Meereen, Yezzan returns to represent [[Astapor]], whose slave-masters were reconstituted by Yunkai. He quickly recognizes Tyrion as the dwarf slave and remarks that he has literally climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid. The slaving cities offer Daenerys and her supporters a pot of gold to sail away from [[Slaver's Bay]]. However, Tyrion proposes a counteroffer that slavery be phased out over a seven-year period and that all slave masters be compensated. He leaves them to contemplate his offer."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  [[Tyrion gives a message to a surrendered Yezzan.]] The slaving cities later [[Second Siege of Meereen|besiege]] Meereen with a large fleet."[[No One]]" When the time comes to discuss terms of surrender, Yezzan represents the slavers along with [[Razdal mo Eraz]] and [[Belicho Paenymion]]; he puts forward the slavers' terms that Daenerys and her allies are to leave Meereen, save [[Missandei]] and the [[Unsullied]] who are to be resold, and [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] are to be killed. When Daenerys, [[Drogon]] and [[Grey Worm]] turn the tables on the slavers, Missandei announces that one of the masters must die as punishment for their disobedience. Razdal and Belicho scapegoat Yezzan, citing his low birth, but Grey Worm chooses to cut the throats of Razdal and Belicho instead. Yezzan is sent home with a warning for Astapor - the consequences of opposing Daenerys are dire."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards"]]
