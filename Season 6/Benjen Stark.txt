 6]]=== [[Benjen's training at Winterfell is witnessed in Bran's vision.]] Benjen appears in a vision experienced by Bran Stark. Benjen is shown training with Ned under a young [[Rodrik Cassel]] in the courtyard of Winterfell, though his skills are far inferior to Ned's. Lyanna appears and playfully teases Benjen about not having a sparring partner after Ned goes to the Eyrie, and suggests that [[Hodor|Wylis]] take up swordplay. Benjen almost has a match with him, but he is led away by [[Old Nan]]. Benjen is seen later in another of Bran's visions saying goodbye to Ned shortly before the latter heads off to the Vale."[[Home]]"  Beyond the Wall, when Bran and [[Meera Reed]] are being chased by an army of [[wight]]s, a hooded figure with a concealed face arrives atop a horse, wielding a flaming chain, to burn the wights and rescue the pair. When the wights become too numerous to fight off, he pulls Bran and Meera onto his horse and rides away. The next day, the hooded man feeds Bran the blood of a dead rabbit, and says he arrived to help because the [[Three-Eyed Raven]] requested it.  [[Benjen makes himself known to Bran and Meera.]] When questioned on his identity, he pulls down his scarf and hood, revealing himself as Benjen Stark. Benjen explains that, during his fateful ranging beyond the wall, he was attacked by [[White Walkers]], one of whom shoved an ice sword into his gut and left him for dead. He was discovered by the [[Children of the Forest]], who stopped him from falling to the control of the White Walkers by shoving a piece of [[dragonglass]] into his chest."[[Blood of My Blood]]" [[Benjen bids farewell to Bran and Meera.]] Benjen eventually escorts Bran and Meera to the weirwood tree nearby the Wall. When asked by Meera why he cannot travel any further south, Benjen explains that ancient spells carved into the foundation of the Wall prevent the dead from passing through it. Benjen says he will continue to fight for the living as long as he can, before departing."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
