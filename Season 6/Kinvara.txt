= Kinvara meets with [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] in the [[Great Pyramid|Great Pyramid of Meereen]], as Tyrion plans to ask her assistance in convincing the people to follow Daenerys as their guardian and protector rather than a conqueror or an invader. Tyrion greets her in Valyrian but she stays silent until she states, in the [[Common Tongue]], that he does not need to persuade her into helping. Kinvara is sure that "Daenerys Stormborn is the [[The Prince That Was Promised|one who was promised]]. [[Fire and Blood|From the fire she was reborn]] to remake the world ... Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the [[Great War|great war still to come]]". Citing her freeing of the [[Slavery|slaves]] and her dragons as examples of her claim, Kinvara is happy to assist Daenerys's associates however she can. Before she and Tyrion can complete their agreement, Varys interrupts, pointing out that [[Melisandre]] had proclaimed [[Stannis Baratheon]] to be "the chosen one" with a "glorious destiny", but Stannis was defeated by Tyrion in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and died in the [[Battle of Winterfell (War of the Five Kings)|Battle of Winterfell]].  [[Kinvara analyses Varys.]] He complains about how religion is overly self-assured of its own tenets; how everything is the "will of the Lord", and asks Kinvara why he should believe in her words when another Red Priestess was wrong. Kinvara states that everything ''is'' the will of the Lord, but that men and women can make mistakes. She asks him if he remembers what the voice in the flames said when the "[[Sorcerer|second rate sorcerer]]" threw his man parts into the fire, or if he knows who was speaking on the other side, rendering Varys speechless. She asks if he needs her to speak the very same words, or to identify the speaker; Varys cannot bring himself to answer. As Kinvara turns to leave, she assures Tyrion that she will call on her best priests and preachers to speak about the Queen through all of [[Essos]]."[[The Door]]"
