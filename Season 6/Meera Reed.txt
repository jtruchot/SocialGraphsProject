 6]]=== [[Meera awaits the coming war.]] Meera remains in the Weirwood cave with Bran, Summer, Hodor, Leaf, and the Three-Eyed Raven. After Bran has a vision of [[Eddard Stark|his father]] as a child, he finds Meera sitting just outside the cave entrance. She confides in him that she is having trouble coping with their apparent inaction towards the coming war, and Bran reminds her that it's not safe anywhere outside. After he leaves, Leaf tells her that she needs to protect Bran at all costs."[[Home]]"  [[Meera and Leaf are confronted by the Night King and his army.]]While Meera is sleeping one night, Bran comes into contact with the [[Night King]]. When he wakes up and cries out, Meera awakens as well. The Three-Eyed Raven informs them of their situation. She briefly speaks to Hodor before realizing how close the White Walkers are. Meera rushes to the entrance of the cave and sees the vast army of the dead approaching. On Leaf's orders, she dashes back into the cave, picks up a spear, and frantically tries to wake Bran up from his latest vision. Meera's latest words enter Bran's thoughts, and as the wights enter the cave, she encourages him to warg into Hodor.  She kills several wights and successfully shatters one [[White Walker (The Door)|White Walker]] with a spear of [[dragonglass]]. She carries Bran out of the cave in a cart, begging both present and past Hodor to "hold the door". Although all the other inhabitants of the cave perish, Meera escapes the battle alive with Bran, whilst Hodor is killed by the wights."[[The Door]]" However, Meera struggles to pull both Bran and the cart as they continue to run from the army of the dead. Bran remains despondent, and continues to have visions of both past, present, and future. They are eventually found by the wight horde just as Bran wakes up, and Meera apologizes for not being able to protect him due to their sheer numbers and her exhaustion. Just before the Wights close in, however, a mysterious figure clad in a hooded black cloak arrives, killing several wights with a flaming chain. He pulls Bran and Meera up onto his horse, and they ride away.  [[Meera and Bran receive information from Benjen.]] The mysterious figure, once they have found a safe place to make a fire, reveals himself as [[Benjen Stark]], Bran's uncle, who has previously been thought to be dead. He claims that he was attacked by White Walkers while on a ranging party, and left for dead after being stabbed through the gut, and that the magic of the [[Children of the Forest]] saved his life. He also tells Bran that he has now embodied the [[Three-Eyed Raven]], and must face the [[Night King]] when the time comes.  [[Bran and Meera head for the Wall.]] Meera, Bran, and Benjen eventually arrive at the weirwood tree, not far from the [[Wall]]. Claiming that the magic of the Children of the Forest prevents him from passing beyond the Wall, Benjen says his farewells and once again disappears into the forest, promising to continue to fight for the living. Meera watches while Bran connects to the tree, wary of the events following the last time he warged, who sees a vision of his aunt [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]'s death, and the birth of Jon at the [[Tower of Joy]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
