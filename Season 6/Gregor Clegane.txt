 6]]=== [[180x180px|Gregor begins to persecute anyone who goes against Cersei.]] Gregor is present standing guard over Cersei when Jaime returns from [[Dorne]] with [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s body."[[The Red Woman]]" Later, Gregor continues to serve Cersei without question. He finds a [[King's Landing boaster|man who boasts of having flashed his penis]] at Cersei during her walk and bashes his head against a wall, killing him."[[Home]]" [[Cersei reveals her plan to use Gregor.]] Back at the Red Keep, he accompanies Cersei when she attempts to attend Myrcella's funeral, only to be stopped by a group of Lannister soldiers, who have arrived to prevent her from leaving on King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]'s orders. Although Gregor intimidates the [[Lannister captain (Home)|captain]] with his size, Cersei acquiesces, and he escorts her back to her room.  Gregor follows Cersei and Jaime into Qyburn's laboratory, where the former Maester tries to win the service of the [[little birds]] by offering them candied plums from Dorne; the children are extremely frightened by the towering knight and quickly flee the room. Jaime asks what Qyburn has done to Gregor, to which the latter replies with "a number of things." Jaime wonders whether Gregor is able to understand what they are saying, then insults his intelligence by questioning whether he ever understood complete sentences at all, to which the huge knight menacingly turns his head towards Jaime. Qyburn assures that Gregor understands well enough. Jaime suggested sending Ser Gregor to the High Septon to crush him and his Faith Militants. Cersei disagrees, saying they can't let Ser Gregor face them all and that he only needs to face one, implying the coming trial by combat."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[180x180px|Gregor acts as Cersei's protector when she intervenes the Small Council. ]] At the Small Council, Pycelle expresses his disgusts about Qyburn's treatment of Ser Gregor, calling him an abomination. He attempts to suggest that it would be in everyone's best interest to have the "beast" destroyed, but he was cut short when he becomes aware of the presence of Cersei, Jaime and Gregor himself. Frightened by the huge man, Pycelle cannot keep himself from passing gas. Cersei suggests the Small Council gets on with urgent matters, as they cannot make them leave. Kevan replies that Cersei and Jaime cannot make them stay either, unless they set Gregor to kill them. As everyone except Cersei and Jaime leave, Pycelle cowers past Ser Gregor, who coldly looks back. [[Gregor guards Cersei during her conversation with Olenna.]] After Cersei gets word of Olenna Tyrell's intention to return to Highgarden, she confronts her. Ser Gregor Clegane follows in the Queen Mother's wake and silently stands guard behind her."[[The Broken Man]]" When Lancel and several other members of the Faith Militant enter the Red Keep, Cersei, Qyburn, and Ser Gregor arrive to confront them. Lancel tells Cersei that the High Septon wishes to speak with her, but Cersei refuses, and when Lancel does not leave at her command, Gregor stands in his way as the Faith attempt to forcibly take Cersei. [[Ser Gregor easily kills a member of the Faith Militant.]] He remains unmoved when Lancel orders him to stand down. One of the Sparrows attacked Gregor, and although his weapon's spikes pierce Gregor's plate, Gregor does not say a word or appear to even acknowledge any injury. When the Sparrow tries to attack again, Gregor grabs him by the throat, lifting him into the air and throwing him to the ground. While Lancel and the other Sparrows look on in horror, the towering knight kneels beside him and tears his head off. Lancel and the others thereby stand down."[[No One]]" [[Gregor stands by Cersei as her plan to use him in a trial by combat crumbles.]] Ser Gregor accompanies Cersei and Qyburn to the [[Great Hall]], where Tommen is about to make a royal announcement. As Cersei attempts to stand besides her son, she is barred by Kevan Lannister, who tells her place is on the gallery with the other ladies of the court. Cersei reluctantly takes her place there with Gregor following her, causing the women to hastily make place. Tommen announces that Cersei and Loras will stand trial before seven septons and that trial by combat is forbidden in the Seven Kingdoms, thereby nullifying Cersei's plans on having the Mountain fight as her champion again.  On the day of her and [[Loras Tyrell]]'s trial, Cersei sends Gregor to Tommen's chambers, to prevent him from going to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] to protect him from its destruction. Tommen tries to get past but Gregor easily holds him back. Tommen later commits suicide after hearing of [[Margaery Tyrell]]'s death in the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]].  [[Ser Gregor prepares to torture Septa Unella.]] Gregor is summoned by Cersei to the [[Red Keep]] dungeons after the explosion, being introduced to Cersei's newest prisoner, Septa [[Unella]]. After removing his helmet, revealing his withered and mangled face, Gregor is left alone with Unella, who screams in terror as the Mountain looms over her, ready to carry out his orders to torture the Septa for imprisoning and humiliating Cersei. Later, when Cersei is crowned as queen, he is seen looming beside the Iron Throne, gazing into the crowd."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
