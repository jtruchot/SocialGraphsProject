 6]] === Remembering how Beric was revived by Thoros six times, Melisandre attempts a ritual to resurrect [[Jon Snow]] following his [[Mutiny at Castle Black|murder]], which is successful.  [[right|Beric and Thoros are confronted by The Hound.]] Beric prepares to hang [[Lem]] and two other former members for raiding a community that was building a sept, staining the good name of the Brotherhood. However, the Hound, who had become a member of the community, hunts down Lem and demands he be allowed to kill the man himself, as vengeance for the hanging of Brother [[Ray]]. After some arguing, Beric and Thoros allow the Hound to hang two of the men himself, out of respect for the loss of his friend, but refused to allow him to kill them in a barbaric manner. Beric personally hangs the third man. Later on, Beric offers the Hound a place in the Brotherhood, as he needs good men. He says there are "[[White Walkers|cold winds]]" rising in the [[North]], and he intends to stop them."[[No One]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
