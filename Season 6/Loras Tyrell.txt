= Margaery is permitted to visit Loras in prison. He is worn out and beaten down by the Faith Militant's treatment of him. Margaery tries to get him to stand up for himself and calls him the future of the Tyrells, but Loras states that he just wants his imprisonment to end and wants to acquiesce to their demands. Loras begins to sob uncontrollably, and his sister hugs him close to her chest."[[Book of the Stranger]]" On the morning of his trial, a shivering Loras is shown huddled on the floor of his cell, repeating lines under his breath, suggesting he has been told what to say in advance and is trying to memorize it. He is taken from his cell by members of the [[Faith Militant]] before being bathed, shaven and having his hair cut off.  He is then brought before the [[High Sparrow]] and the assembled nobles in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Loras states that a trial won't be necessary, because he wishes to plead guilty to all accusations laid against him.  [[Loras confesses before the High Sparrow.]] He confesses to having lain with other men, including Renly, and his voice breaks with emotion as he says Renly's name, following which the High Sparrow turns and looks at Margaery in a very pointed way. Loras' emotion at saying Renly's name, and the High Sparrow looking at Margaery in a displeased way as a result, suggests that Loras has not actually been brainwashed into believing his sexuality and his relationship with Renly were wrong, but that he has been obliged to pretend this is the case in order to persuade the High Sparrow to let him out of prison.   The High Sparrow's glance at Margaery suggests that she told him Loras had genuinely converted, but that Loras' emotion in mentioning Renly has made the High Sparrow skeptical that this is the case. However, Loras hastily regathers himself, and as he lists a number of other things the Faith considers to be crimes, the High Sparrow seems more convinced again.  [[A recently mutilated Loras huddles close to his sister, second before his death.]] As part of the confession and plea to be given mercy, Loras has to agree to join the Faith Militant and renounce his inheritance. The seven pointed star is then carved into his forehead by Brother Lancel as his sister and father look on in horror. When Cersei doesn't show up to her own trial, Margaery realizes that something is seriously amiss. She attempts to lead her brother to safety, but the Sparrows prevent this, and he dies alongside his sister and father when Cersei [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|burns the Great Sept to the ground]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"
