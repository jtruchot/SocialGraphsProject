She is jealous of [[Lady Crane]], who portrays the much larger role of [[Cersei Lannister]] (Sansa only has two lines).

"[[The Door]]"  The next day, as the play finishes, Arya notices Bianca secretly mouthing Lady Crane's lines from backstage, confirming her suspicions. Though Arya poisons Lady Crane's rum, she stops her from drinking it and tells her to watch out for Bianca."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  Days later, Arya asks Lady Crane what happened to Bianca. Lady Crane's reply implies that she disfigured Bianca's face enough to make it impossible for Bianca to find more work as an actress, but that she left Bianca alive."[[No One]]"
