 6]]=== Since the [[Citadel]] only allows men within its walls, Samwell decides to send Gilly and her baby Sam to live with his family at Horn Hill. While Sam admits that he does not get on well with his father Randyll, he reassures Gilly that his mother and sister are nice."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[Randyll receives Samwell at an awkward dinner.]] When Sam and Gilly arrive at Horn Hill, Randyll assumes she is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] from [[Mole's Town]], something that he manages to come to terms with. Gilly is dressed in southern clothes, and she, Sam, Randyll, Dickon, Melessa, and Talla all have dinner together. At the table, Randyll repeatedly berates Sam: he insults his weight, tells him the Night's Watch failed to make a man out of him, and says he will never be a great warrior, or inherit [[Heartsbane]], the Tarly family's ancestral [[Valyrian steel]] sword.  [[Randyll deduces Gilly's nature.]] Gilly rushes to defend him, telling Randyll that Sam killed a [[Thenn warg|Thenn]] and a [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|White Walker]] on his way down to [[Castle Black]]. By saying this, she lets slip that she is in fact a wildling, a group of people who Randyll apparently considers to be subhuman. Randyll's bigotry, particularly when just used as another way to insult Sam, is the last straw for Melessa, who storms out of the hall with Gilly and Talla, declaring that it isn't Sam who is dishonoring House Tarly. Randyll then says he'll let Gilly stay and work in the kitchens, and even will acknowledge Little Sam as a Tarly [[Bastardy|bastard]]. However, upon his departure the following morning, Sam will never be allowed at Horn Hill again."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  Sam decides not to leave Gilly and her son at Horn Hill and silently departs with them in the night. Before leaving the castle, Sam steals Heartsbane. Gilly is worried that Randyll will come after them - not for his son but for his sword - to which Sam replies that Randyll can "bloody well try".  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
