 6]]=== When the Greatjon's son, [[Smalljon Umber]], arrives at [[Winterfell]] to hand Rickon over to [[Ramsay Bolton]], he reveals that the Greatjon has died, and Ramsay accordingly addresses the Smalljon as "Lord Umber". He tells Ramsay he might have killed his father himself if he had not "died on his own", implying that his relationship with his father was not a pleasant one."[[Oathbreaker]]"  During [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and [[Gilly]]'s visit at [[Horn Hill]], [[Melessa Tarly|Sam's mother]] mentions that she and [[Randyll Tarly|her husband]] once met Lord Umber from Last Hearth, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt (since Smalljon has become Lord Umber only recently, the lord to whom Melessa refers is presumably the Greatjon)."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  Smalljon then betrays his father's beliefs and House Umber's previous loyalty to House Stark by offering Rickon and Osha as a gift to House Bolton, to be held as prisoners and used as leverage against the Starks. Smalljon is later killed by [[Tormund]] in the [[Battle of the Bastards]], which ends with House Stark's restoration as the rulers of the North and the extinction of House Bolton."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
