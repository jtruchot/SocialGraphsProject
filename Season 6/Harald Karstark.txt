 6]]=== Harald appears before [[Roose Bolton]] and his son [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]] at [[Winterfell]], reporting that his men had found the remains of the Bolton hunting party that was sent to track down [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. Harald nods in agreement when Ramsay proposes that they storm [[Castle Black]] to retrieve Sansa and kill [[Jon Snow]]. He counsels Roose that, despite being a bastard, Jon still presents a threat to the Boltons' rule of the [[North]] as [[Eddard Stark]]'s last surviving son. He affirms his house's loyalty to House Bolton, saying that he will never follow a Stark again after Robb executed his father. When Maester [[Wolkan]] arrives to announce that [[Walda Bolton]] has given birth to a [[Bolton (son of Roose)|boy]], Harald congratulates Roose but then witnesses Ramsay quickly kill his father to save himself from being disinherited in favor of his new trueborn half-brother. When Ramsay orders Wolkan to send ravens bearing false news that Roose was poisoned by his enemies, Harald chastises Wolkan for failing to address Ramsay as "Lord", and makes no effort to dissuade Ramsay from murdering Walda and her baby as well."[[Home]]"  Harald and Ramsay later meet with [[Smalljon Umber]], the new [[Lord of the Last Hearth]]. Harald notes that the Umbers are loyal to House Stark, but Smalljon retorts by noting that the Karstarks share blood with the Starks, yet Harald is now pledged to Ramsay Bolton. Harald casts doubt on the possibility of the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] taking Winterfell, but Smalljon says that, with Jon in command, it would be possible. When Smalljon brings in [[Osha]] and [[Rickon Stark]], he quips that Harald has an interest in young boys, visibly angering him."[[Oathbreaker]]"  When news of the Karstarks and Umbers declaring for Ramsay reaches Sansa at Castle Black, she says the Umbers can hang for giving her brother to Ramsay but the Karstarks did so without knowing that they had "another choice." However, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] reminds her of Robb's folly when he executed Harald's father."[[The Door]]"[[Harald Karstark during the Battle of the Bastards.]]Harald accompanies Ramsay to a [[parley]] with Jon and Sansa, and departs with his Lord back to Winterfell when negotiations turn sour. He later leads his army into battle at the [[Battle of the Bastards]], and leads the cavalry charge when Jon is standing all by himself in the middle of the battlefield. However, they are met head on by the Stark cavalry, and fired upon by their own archers on Ramsay's orders. Harald is killed in the ensuing carnage."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
