 6]]=== [[180x180px|Ser Arthur Dayne with Lord Commander Gerold Hightower at the Tower of Joy.]] Ser Arthur Dayne is seen with Ser [[Gerold Hightower]], the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] under King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], in a vision when Bran Stark sees into the past with the aid of the [[Three-Eyed Raven]]. Near the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]], Ser Arthur and Ser Gerold were stationed to guard the [[Tower of Joy]] by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] himself. When Lord [[Eddard Stark]] of [[Winterfell]] arrives with his bannermen, including Lord [[Howland Reed]], in order to rescue the captive [[Lyanna Stark]], Ser Arthur and Ser [[Gerold Hightower]] prevent the Northmen from entering the tower, peacefully. Ser Arthur is shown to be cordial to Eddard, but refuses to tell him why exactly the now-deceased Rhaegar wanted them to remain there or the whereabouts of Eddard's sister. Knowing there is no alternative, Ser Arthur and Ser Gerold fight the Northmen to hold the tower. Gerold is quickly killed by Lord Eddard in the melee, but Ser Arthur easily holds his own against the Northmen, cutting down most of them with his two swords, leaving just him and Eddard. As Bran watches them duel, he observes that Dayne is a better swordsman than his father. The Three-Eyed Raven corrects him: "''far'' better". Dayne eventually disarms Eddard but as he moves to strike him down, [[Howland Reed]], who had been wounded earlier in the battle, sneaks up behind Dayne and stabs him in the back of the neck.  [[180x180px|Ser Arthur is stabbed by Howland Reed before Ned Stark finishes him off with Dawn.]] Ser Arthur is mortally wounded by the attack and falls to his knees, holding on to [[Dawn|his sword]] for a few seconds before dropping it as his strength fades. The two look at each other as Eddard picks up Dawn, seeming ashamed of how he had survived. Although in agony, Arthur seems accepting of his fate; he had done his duty to the last."[[House Dayne (featurette)|House Dayne]]" Eddard delivers the final blow, killing the legendary Sword of the Morning and sparing him from a slower, crueler death."[[Oathbreaker]]"  After killing Dayne, Eddard runs up into the tower where he finds Lyanna, dying after giving birth to Rhaegar's last living son, whom Eddard would pass off as his bastard son, [[Jon Snow]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|
