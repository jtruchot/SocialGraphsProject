 6]]=== [[Obara kills Trystane.]] Ellaria dispatches Obara and her sister [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] to [[King's Landing]] with the intention of killing Prince Trystane, which Obara obeys with no objection. The sisters ambush the young prince aboard his ship, Obara telling him of their intentions, and laughing at him when he attempts to reason with them since they are family. Though Trystane chooses to fight Nymeria first, Obara [[Kinslaying|kills]] him by stabbing him through the back of the head with her spear, and smiles at his bloody corpse."[[The Red Woman]]" [[Obara attempts to intimidate Olenna.]] Months later, the Sand Snakes are present when Ellaria meets with [[Olenna Tyrell]] in the Water Gardens. The Queen of Thorns shuts down Obara when she attempts to speak, condescendingly asking if her name is "Barbaro". Ellaria claims that Dorne and [[House Tyrell]] must work together for justice and vengeance, as [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] has declared war on both of their factions. [[Varys]] then appears, claiming that they will defeat Cersei with "Fire and Blood", making it clear that Ellaria, the Sand Snakes, and House Tyrell will support [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s claim to the Seven Kingdoms."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
