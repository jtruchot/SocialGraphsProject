= Rickard is mentioned by his last living son Harald when he meets with the Boltons at Winterfell. Harald makes it clear that his House will never support the Starks again after Robb executed his father. Despite the fact that Roose avenged his father by killing Robb at the [[Red Wedding]], Harald makes no attempt to intervene when Ramsay [[Assassination at Winterfell|kills]] Roose after the birth of his [[Bolton (son of Roose)|half-brother]], whom Ramsay also murders along with his stepmother, [[Walda Bolton]]."[[Home]]"  While planning to counter the Boltons' claim to the North, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] expresses her belief that the Karstarks will support them when they learn of [[Jon Snow|Jon]]'s resurrection, but [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] reminds her that Rickard was executed by Robb, which is likely why Rickard's last surviving son has sided with the Starks' enemies and not out of ignorance as Sansa had hoped."[[The Door]]"
