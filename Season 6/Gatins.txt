= Gatins and two of his fellow brothers, [[Lem]] and [[Morgan (The Broken Man)|Morgan]], confront [[Ray]]'s group of Faith devout, asking them for food and supplies. When Ray claims that he has nothing of true value to give them and that he has many mouths to feed, they leave, and possibly were responsible for the slaughter of everyone, except for [[Sandor Clegane]]."[[The Broken Man]]"  [[Morgan (The Broken Man)|Morgan]] and Gatins educate [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] members [[Steve]] and [[Riddell]] as to how to best kiss a girl. According to Gatins, this is best done by sticking one's middle finger up the rectum while kissing. While demonstrating this act tenderly to Steve, they are interrupted by the Hound, who kills them all with his axe. Clegane slashes Gatins at the waist and asks where the rest of the Brotherhood is, to which Gatins replies "Fuck you!". Sandor admonishes his poor choice in last words and urges him to try harder. Gatins calls Sandor a cunt, and Sandor gives up on getting anything more satisfying. He tells Gatins that he is "shit at dying" before burying his axe into his head, killing him."[[No One]]"
