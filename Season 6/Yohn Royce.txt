 6]]=== [[right|Royce confronts Baelish on his travel plans with Sansa.]] Royce oversees Robin Arryn's archery training, watching in contempt as Robin repeatedly fails to hit the marks and forces a very painful looking smile when the young lord looks at him for approval. The training is interrupted when Baelish arrives by carriage. Royce is outraged as Baelish told him that he and Sansa Stark would return to the [[Fingers]], yet Sansa was married to [[Ramsay Bolton]] at Winterfell. Baelish uses the opportunity, falsely claiming that on the way to the Fingers they were attacked by a vast Bolton host which seemed to have inside knowledge of Baelish's travel plans. [[Lord Royce declares his loyalty to House Arryn.]] Baelish reveals that Royce was the only one he told about his route and begins casting aspersions on his loyalty, to which Royce reacts with anger at being accused in his own home, before asking Robin how to fare with him. Although Robin at first plans to throw Royce out of the Moon Door, Baelish advises him to spare Royce because of his loyalty to House Arryn. With the dark realization that Robin is under Baelish's control, Royce pleads with Robin for another chance, and Robin agrees. Royce is named commander of the armies of the Vale and told to round up the Vale's soldiers in order to march North and save Sansa from Ramsay."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  The Vale reinforcements win a [[Battle of the Bastards|crushing victory]] against the [[House Bolton|Bolton]] infantry, slaughtering the phalanx surrounding the depleted [[House Stark|Stark]] forces and allowing [[Jon Snow]] to liberate [[Winterfell]] with a [[Free Folk|wildling]] force."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]" Lord Royce later voices to Jon his disgust at the knights of the Vale allying themselves with "wildling invaders". [[Tormund|Tormund Giantsbane]] explains that they were invited, but Lord Royce responds that he was not the one who invited them. He later watches on as Lady [[Lyanna Mormont]], Lord [[Wyman Manderly]], and Lord [[Robett Glover]] proclaim their allegiance to Jon Snow as the new [[King in the North]], and joins them in declaring his allegiance to the new King in the North alongside the other lords of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
