= Lem arrives with two other former members of the Brotherhood in an attempt to extort the band of villagers, which includes Brother [[Ray]] and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. However, upon learning that the villagers hold nothing of interest he and his companions leave. He and other members of his group were responsible for the slaughter of the villagers, and the hanging of Ray."[[The Broken Man]]"  Sandor hunts down [[Gatins]], [[Morgan (The Broken Man)|Morgan]], and their cohorts in a forest, killing them. Later he finds [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Thoros]] preparing to hang them for the unsanctioned attack on the village. While they refuse to allow Sandor to execute the murderers through brutal mutilation, and insist on killing one of the murderers themselves because the raid on the actions have stained the Brotherhood's honor and good name, they allow him to hang Lem and one other man out of respect for Sandor's more personal loss at their hands. Sandor takes Lem's boots for himself while Lem vainly struggles for air, and is invited to join the Brotherhood's mission to fight up North."[[No One]]"
