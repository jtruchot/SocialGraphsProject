 6]]=== Remembering how Thoros revived Beric six times, Melisandre attempts a ritual to resurrect [[Jon Snow]] following his [[Mutiny at Castle Black|murder]], which is successful. [[Beric and Thoros are confronted by The Hound.]] Thoros helps Beric to [[Execution|hang]] [[Lem]] and two other rogue Brotherhood members for raiding a religious community and slaughtering its people, slandering the Brotherhood's reputation. Sandor Clegane arrives, having hunted Lem down for the attack, and demands to be allowed to kill the men himself. When Thoros sees Sandor he asks "the fuck you doing here?", mirroring the Hound's earlier words to him. When he is given the permission to kill the men, Sandor moves to use his axe, but is stopped by Thoros, who says that the Brotherhood are not butchers - the men must be hanged. He later tells the Hound that Beric and Sandor have both survived for a reason."[[No One]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
