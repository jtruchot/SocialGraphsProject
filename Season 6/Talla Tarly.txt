Since the Citadel does not accept women and children, he plans to send [[Gilly]] and her baby [[Sam]] to live with his family at Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father Randyll, he gets on with Talla and their mother Melessa."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Talla eagerly greets Sam as he arrives with Gilly and her baby, complaining about her arranged marriage to the old, yellow-toothed [[Symun Fossoway]]. Talla takes Gilly under her wing and starts musing on what color she would look best in. She also offers to put Gilly up in one of her bedrooms. [[Talla and her family have dinner with Gilly.]] At dinner, Talla makes small talk with Gilly, and is impressed that Gilly can hunt for herself, as Randyll never saw the need for her to learn. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a wildling, Melessa listens to his rant before giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
