= Ornela is present when [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is introduced to the ''dosh khaleen''."[[Oathbreaker]]"  In the temple of the ''dosh khaleen'', the [[High priestess of the dosh khaleen|high priestess]] points out a Dothraki widow as a young member of the crones to Daenerys. She mentions that she was a [[Lhazareen]] ''[[khaleesi]]'' who was married off at age 12. When she bore her ''khal'' a daughter one year later, he broke her ribs. Her ''khal'' died when she was sixteen. The high priestess used Ornela to illustrate her contemptuous opinion of ''khaleen'' who disliked Daenerys because of her non-Dothraki appearance, pointing out that Dothraki had always intermarried and interbred with outsiders.  [[Daenerys convinces Daario Naharis and Ser Jorah Mormont not to kill Ornela.]] When Daenerys asks to be let out of temple temporarily, she is accompanied by the Dothraki widow. Daenerys is friendly towards her and quips that her abusive ''khal'' should have died sooner, a sentiment which cheers the widow somewhat. Ornela expresses excitement over the thought of Daenerys's [[dragon]]s. Suddenly, she is seized by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Daario Naharis]]. They are about to kill her because they think that she will betray them, but Daenerys convinces them not to do so. Ornela later brings Daenerys before the ''[[khalar vezhven]]'', and is among the many who bow to Daenerys when they see her emerge unburnt from the conflagration at the Temple."[[Book of the Stranger]]"
