 6]]=== Lothar and Black Walder inform their father that [[Brynden Tully]] has retaken [[Riverrun]], and of the opposition they face from other Riverlands houses and the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. Walder admonishes his sons for letting the Blackfish slip through their fingers at the Red Wedding and orders them to retake Riverrun by using the captive Edmure for bargaining with. He also tells Lothar to present Brynden with the knife he used to kill Talisa and her unborn child."[[Blood of My Blood]]" Subsequently, Lothar and Black Walder command a [[Second Siege of Riverrun|siege of Riverrun]]. They prove to be incompetent commanders and fail to secure their flanks or to dig trenches.  [[180x180px|Lothar is chastised by Jaime Lannister.]] In an attempt to force the Blackfish to surrender, they force Edmure to wear a noose around his neck and threaten to kill him. However, the Blackfish is undaunted and calls their bluff. Later, [[House Lannister]] reinforcements arrive under [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Bronn]]. Jaime chastises the Freys for their incompetence and takes command of the siege. He also orders Lothar and Black Walder to feed and wash Edmure. When Black Walder refuses, Jaime backhands him across the face and informs the Freys that they can return home if they do not agree with his methods. Lothar is apologetic and sycophantic in contrast to his bastard half-brother."[[The Broken Man]]" [[180x180px|Lothar is carved into a pie.]] Lothar is later present at the Twins, where the Freys and the Lannisters celebrate their successful siege of Riverrun. He is afterwards [[Assassinations at the Twins|killed]] by [[Arya Stark]], who presumably learns (while disguised as a servant) of how he killed her pregnant sister-in-law. She minces his flesh and bakes him into [[Frey pie|a pie]] together with Black Walder, which she then serves to their father before slitting his throat, as Black Walder did to her [[Catelyn Stark|mother]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
