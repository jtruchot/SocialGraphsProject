= Bran and the [[Three-Eyed Raven]] watch the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy]] between Ned Stark, Howland Reed, and four other Stark bannermen against two members of [[Aerys II Targaryen]]'s Kingsguard; Ser [[Arthur Dayne]], the [[Sword of the Morning]], and [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Gerold Hightower]]. Howland Reed is the first to charge in, receiving a slash across the chest by Dayne. The other Stark bannermen are killed along with Ser Gerold, leaving Ned Stark and Dayne to face each other. The two warriors briefly duel. However, Dayne's superior fighting skills get the best of Ned and he is disarmed.   [[Howland stabs Arthur, saving Ned, who finishes him off with Dawn.]] Just as Dayne is about to strike Ned down, Howland - whom Dayne had assumed was mortally wounded earlier in the fight - rushes him from behind and stabs him through the back of the neck. Ned quickly ends Dayne's suffering with a slash to the neck, nearly lopping his head off. Howland is badly injured but survives, rushing to check the bodies of the fallen, while Ned continues on into the tower."[[Oathbreaker]]""[[The Winds of Winter]]"
