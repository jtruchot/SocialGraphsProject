= Razdal represents the Wise Masters of Yunkai and alongside [[Belicho Paenymion]] of Volantis, and [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]] of Astapor. They attend a meeting with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], who is working to cut those cities' support to the [[Sons of the Harpy]]. When Tyrion attempts to reassure the envoys that Daenerys is not long for Slaver's Bay, Razdal reminds the assembled that the last time he offered Daenerys a chance to return to Westeros, she rejected the deal. Razdal seems intrigued by Tyrion's proposal to end slavery in Astapor and Yunkai gradually with reparations, but seems somewhat unimpressed by the whores that Tyrion offers the envoys at the end of the meeting."[[Book of the Stranger]]"[[Razdal meets with Dany and her council before his death.]] Later, the Masters break their pact with Meereen and assault the city with a large fleet. After bombarding the city with flaming trebuchets, the three emissaries meet Daenerys and her entourage to demand her surrender. They tell Dany that they will let her and Tyrion leave the city if they hand over the Unsullied and Missandei to be resold into slavery, and her dragons to be slaughtered. Daenerys clarifies that the meeting was ''her'' offering ''them'' a chance to surrender. A moment later, Drogon flies up and intimidates the emissaries, with Dany taking flight on his back shortly thereafter. She rides Drogon into the bay as [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] emerge from a pyramid to join them and they begin to burn an attacking ship. It is obvious to Razdal that he has made a grave mistake. The Masters' soldiers abandon them, and Missandei announces that one of the three masters must die, as punishment for their disobedience.  Yezzan, the lowest of the three, is immediately scapegoated by the other two for not being highborn. Grey Worm instead kills Razdal and Belicho with a single slash of his dagger."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"
