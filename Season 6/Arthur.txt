It's revealed that Qyburn has done away with Arthur's abusive father, and has taken the boy under his wing along with the rest of the little birds. When another child asks about Lord Varys, Arthur reveals that he and the other children were the eunuch's network of 'little birds'. Qyburn bribes the children with candied plums to take allegiance with him, and do for him what they did for Varys."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Later on, Arthur lures [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] from the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] to a maze of tunnels underneath the Sept. Taking advantage of the dark, he stabs the unsuspecting [[Sparrows|sparrow]] in the spine, paralyzing him. He studies the man, before leaving him to die, and flees down the tunnels."[[The Winds of Winter]]"
