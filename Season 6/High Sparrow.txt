= [[The High Sparrow shows compassion towards Margaery.]] The High Sparrow stops Septa Unella from physically chastising a restive Queen Margaery. Though he refuses to answer Margaery's questions regarding her brother's well-being, he does reveal that King Tommen misses her. The High Sparrow believes the love between man and wife is sacred, but sin can cloud this. When the Queen refuses to confess to any wrongdoing, he asks whether Margaery truly considers herself to be without sin of any kind. He is pleased when the Queen at least concedes that everyone makes mistakes."[[The Red Woman]]"  [[The High Sparrow interrupts Myrcella's funeral. ]] The Sparrow walks in on [[Jaime Lannister]] and Tommen making amends at the crypt of [[Myrcella Baratheon]]. The King demands to speak to his Queen. The leader of The Faith informs Tommen that as long as Margaery hasn't confessed and atoned, she will remain in seclusion. After Tommen takes his leave, Jaime expresses his ire about the Faith daring to humiliate his sister, but the Sparrow quips that Cersei was merely atoning for all her heinous sins, which she 'freely' confessed to.  Boldly, Jaime demands to know whether his own sins can be forgiven, and moves to kill the leader of the Faith. Unfazed, the High Sparrow declares that though each member of the Faith is small and insignificant, united they toppled an empire. Jaime soon realizes he's surrounded by the Faith Militant and is forced to stay his hand, despite the High Sparrow calmly daring the Kingslayer to cut him down."[[Home]]"  Later, the High Sparrow has an audience with King Tommen, who petitions for his mother Cersei to be granted permission to visit her deceased daughter, Myrcella. The Sparrow declines the King's request on the grounds that Cersei has not been cleared of her crimes, namely [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert's murder]] and [[incest]]. When Tommen criticizes the Sparrow's legalistic treatment of his mother, he professes admiration for the deep love between mother and son, which he attributes to the [[Mother]]. However, he assures Tommen that he has no vendetta against his mother but is merely carrying out the will of the [[Seven]]. Before Tommen leaves, he tells the King to pray to the Seven and that the gods have worked through his [[Tywin Lannister|grandfather]] and mother even though they may not acknowledge it."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[Margaery manipulates the High Sparrow into seeing Loras.]] The High Sparrow summons Queen Margaery. When the Queen enters, he asks her where she would go if he were to release her. When Margaery truthfully answers she would return to her family, the Sparrow warns her that this would lead her to slip back into sinful behavior. His High Holiness explains to Margaery how and why he became so pious and devoted to the [[Faith of the Seven]]. The Sparrow then allows Margaery to visit [[Loras Tyrell|her brother]]."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  Tommen comes inquiring about Margaery's well-being once more. This time around the High Sparrow is quite accommodating and agrees with the King that the Queen has always stood by the common people, and is now showing signs of embracing the Faith as well. His High Holiness finally allows Tommen some time alone with his wife.  [[The unity of the Crown and the Faith is shown during the standoff at the Great Sept of Baelor.]] When the Tyrell army led by Jaime and Lord Mace come to demand Margaery and Loras' release, the High Sparrow initially refuses even in the face of death. After some tense moments, his High Holiness surprises all present by stating that Margaery won't be performing a walk of atonement. The Queen has shown true devotion to the Seven and has even brought Tommen into their ranks, so there is no need for punishment of any kind. With the King and Queen now faithful followers of the Faith, the High Sparrow has gained complete control of King's Landing in all but name."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  His Holiness walks in on Queen Margaery piously reading from the Seven Pointed Star. After briefly discussing the The Mother, the High Sparrow asks Margaery if they can discuss a personal matter. Tommen has told the Sparrow that since his wife's release, they have yet to share the marriage bed. Margaery tries to explain that she is just treading carefully to avoid relapsing into sin. The Sparrow reassures her that a wife giving her husband an heir is no sin; it is her duty. The High Sparrow then makes a thinly veiled threat against Margaery's grandmother, [[Olenna Tyrell]], stating that while she is a remarkable woman, the 'Queen Of Thorns' is also an unrepentant sinner."[[The Broken Man]]"  It now becomes apparent that his High Holiness wields significant influence over King Tommen, and is fast becoming the de facto ruler of King's Landing. After Cersei refuses to speak with him, ordering [[Gregor Clegane]] to kill a Faith Militant member in the process, The High Sparrow convinces Tommen to abolish trial by combat via royal decree. The new Faith declares the practice to be barbaric, sinful and an attempt of the corrupt to evade divine justice. Henceforth, all trials will be presided over by seven members of the Faith, as it was in the days before House Targaryen conquered the Seven Kingdoms."[[No One]]" [[The High Sparrow forgives Loras.]] On the day of Cersei's and Loras' trials, the High Sparrow and many of the city's elite gather at the Great Sept of Baelor. Loras is brought forward and confesses to his homosexuality and begs to atone by giving up his name and titles as the heir of House Tyrell. The High Sparrow agrees and has Loras mutilated, by having the seven-pointed star carved into his forehead.  [[The High Sparrow is engulfed in wildfire when the caches beneath the Great Sept explode.]] However, Cersei fails to appear at her respective trial, and the High Sparrow sends Lancel to retrieve her. Margaery becomes suspicious of both Cersei and Tommen's absence and tries to warn the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow dismisses these suspicions and prevents them from departing, having his sparrows block the doors. A wildfire cache (stored beneath the sept years before by [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] as part of [[Wildfire plot|his plan]] to deny King's Landing to the rebels and rediscovered by [[Qyburn]] at Cersei's behest) is then ignited and completely [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroys the Great Sept]], killing countless people including the High Sparrow, Queen Margaery, and most of his followers."[[The Winds of Winter]]"
