 6]]=== Walder Frey's dominion over the Riverlands is weakened when Brynden Tully reclaims Riverrun from the Freys with what remains of House Tully's armies."[[The Door]]" [[Walder furiously chastises his sons following the Tully's capture of Riverrun.]] Walder learns of the capture of Riverrun, and the subsequent rising of the other Riverlands Houses against House Frey, from Lame Lothar and Black Walder, which sends him into a fury. He accosts them for allowing Brynden to escape the Red Wedding alive in the first place, and demands they take back Riverrun. To do so, they will use the captive Edmure as a hostage, demanding that his sons show Brynden the knives they used to kill Talisa (along with her unborn child) and Catelyn. Walder rages that he knows the other riverlords still laugh at him, and says that, despite his age, he will not die until they choke on their laughter."[[Blood of My Blood]]" [[Jaime and Walder discuss House Frey's longevity without House Lannister's influence.]] During the feast at the Twins and following the defeat of House Tully, Walder Frey gloats over his "victory". He arrogantly tries to compare himself to [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and build some kind of rapport with him; however, a furious Jaime coldly reminds Walder his House is held in contempt by the rest of the Riverlands and needs the Lannisters to enforce their rule. He warns if the Freys continue to prove themselves incompetent of holding their territory, the Lannisters will refuse to bail them out the next time they need help, leaving Walder speechless. Shortly after the Lannister army leaves, Walder dines on a piece of [[Frey pie|pie]] as a serving girl brings him another piece.  [[Walder is killed by Arya Stark, avenging the Red Wedding.]] He correctly deduces the girl is not one of his progeny as she is "too pretty", slaps her rear, and gives her a lascivious look but his mood quickly turns sour over the tardiness of Black Walder and Lothar. The girl replies that they are right there, revealing they are in the very pie that he was eating. Walder goes into a state of shock and looks back at the girl who then reveals her true identity: [[Arya Stark]], wearing a mask she stole from the [[Hall of Faces]]. Walder Frey attempts to flee but Arya pulls him back and slits his throat open, the same way her mother, Catelyn, was killed, and watches with satisfaction as Walder bleeds out and dies."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
