 6]]=== [[Lyanna receives House Stark.]] Lyanna is one of the Northern leaders being visited by [[Jon Snow]], [[Sansa Stark]], and [[Davos Seaworth]], who are attempting to rally the North against [[House Bolton]] who currently occupies [[Winterfell]]. Sansa and Jon try to flatter her, but Lyanna brusquely brushes them off, demands to know why they are at Bear Island, and questions whether Jon and Sansa are technically even Starks, the former being a [[Bastardy|bastard]], and the latter being twice married into enemy houses. She refuses to offer her men to them until Davos steps in. [[Lyanna personally leading men when Jon travels to Stannis' old camp.]] He tells her that the real war is not between different houses, but between the living and [[White Walkers|the dead]]; a divided North cannot hope to stand against the [[Night King]]. After some reflection, Lady Mormont agrees to help, but can only offer sixty-two fighting men (as so many of their soldiers were massacred at the [[Red Wedding]]). Undaunted, she insists that the hardy warriors of Bear Island are worth many times their own number in battle. She personally leads these men when Jon travels to Stannis's old camp.  [[Lyanna scowls at Ramsay Bolton during the parley before the battle.]]Lyanna is present when Jon and Sansa parley with [[Ramsay Bolton]] ahead of their [[Battle of the Bastards|battle]]. She doesn't speak, but scowls at Ramsay when he mockingly says he'll pardon any Northern lords for treason if they lay down their arms (knowing everything he says is a lie). She does not fight during the battle itself, and presumably stayed behind at the camp."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  Lyanna is among those present at Winterfell after the battle. As the knights of the Vale, the many Northern lords, and the Free Folk bicker, she stands in the assembly and calls out the Manderlys, Glovers, and Cerwyns for refusing Jon and Sansa's call to arms. She then declares that she doesn't care if Jon is a bastard, because Ned Stark's blood runs through his veins. She is the first to proclaim Jon the new King in the North, and is quickly followed by the others."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
