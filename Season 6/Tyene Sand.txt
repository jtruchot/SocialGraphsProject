 6]]=== [[Tyene kills Areo.]] Tyene and Ellaria are with Doran when a maester appears to deliver a message, bearing news of Ellaria's murder of Myrcella. Before the prince has a chance to react Tyene stabs [[Areo Hotah]] in the spine, killing him immediately before Ellaria assassinates Doran. Tyene also kills Maester [[Caleotte]] by throwing her dagger into his back as he tries to flee, despite Caleotte possessing no threat whatsoever (it is possible that Tyene killed him just for fun), and watches with satisfaction as her uncle bleeds to death."[[The Red Woman]]" [[180x180px|The Sand Snakes, Ellaria and Olenna decide to join Daenerys.]] Months later, Tyene is present with her sisters when Ellaria meets with [[Olenna Tyrell]] in the Water Gardens. The Queen of Thorns shuts down Tyene when she attempts to speak, demanding that the "grown women" speak without interruption. Ellaria claims that Dorne and [[House Tyrell]] must work together for justice and vengeance, as [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] has declared war on both of their factions. [[Varys]] then appears, claiming that they will defeat Cersei with "Fire and Blood", making it quite clear that Ellaria, the Sand Snakes, and House Tyrell will support [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s claim to the Seven Kingdoms."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
