 6]]=== [[Varys and Missandei attend Tyrion's meeting.]] Missandei works with Tyrion, Grey Worm, and [[Varys]] to maintain the Queen's peace in the city. One day, whilst discussing [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] (and their lack of appetite following Daenerys's departure from Meereen), Tyrion mentions that since they were used to Missandei's presence when they were younger and never once harmed her, they would probably be comfortable around her now, should they be freed. In response, Tyrion hopes that the reportedly intelligent nature of the dragons will win out when he visits them in catacombs."[[Home]]"  [[Tyrion tries to persuade Missandei and Grey Worm to drink with him.]] Whilst Varys is dealing with [[Vala]], Tyrion attempts to engage Missandei and Grey Worm in conversation. Neither of them are very good at small talk, however, and both are bewildered by his behavior. When Tyrion tries to engage them in a drinking game, Missandei says that neither of them drink. When Varys finally enters and rescues them from the conversation, Missandei cautions against immediate reprisals against Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, since they need their troops to protect Meereen. Missandei states the Masters of Slaver's Bay only speak one "language" (violence and war), and they must answer accordingly. In the end, Tyrion convinces Varys to use his network of [[little birds]] to open communications with the opposing cities' leaders."[[Oathbreaker]]"  [[Missandei and Grey Worm criticize Tyrion's methods.]] Missandei counsels Tyrion before and during his meeting with the envoys Masters of the slave cities of [[Essos]] ([[Belicho Paenymion]] representing [[Volantis]], [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]] representing Astapor and [[Razdal mo Eraz]] representing Yunkai), distressing Missandei at the fact that Tyrion is seeking to approach them on more peaceful terms. When Tyrion states that he has experienced the horrors of slavery, Missandei is insulted considering he only experienced slavery for a very short time in comparison to her time as one; she states he does not understand.  [[Missandei attends a conference with the slave-city envoys.]] During the meeting, Missandei defends Daenerys's [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay|liberation of the slaves]]. She is shocked in response to Tyrion's compromise of a seven-year transition period, angered at the envoys' defense that slavery is the way their world works. Nevertheless, she reluctantly supports him in front of a delegation of former slaves led by [[Ash]] and [[Kesh]], quoting Tyrion in order to convince them. In private, she and Grey Worm argue that no matter what, Tyrion will become a pawn of the masters, as that is their way, forever seeing those below them as objects to use to their benefit."[[Book of the Stranger]]"  Missandei, along with Grey Worm and Varys, are present when Tyrion announces that he has arranged a meeting with [[Kinvara]], the High Priestess of the [[Red Temple]] at [[Volantis]]. To convince the Meereenese that everything is going befittingly with Daenerys's blessing, Tyrion secures an agreement with the [[Kinvara|Red Priestess]] to preach that Dany is [[The Prince That Was Promised]]."[[The Door]]"  [[Missandei watches as Tyrion's methods in maintaining peace in Meereen fall apart.]] Later, Missandei and Grey Worm exchange wine and jokes at the [[Great Pyramid]]. While reluctant to drink, Missandei and Grey Worm do so in honor of their Queen. After Tyrion tells a joke about Westerosi lords in a bar, she tells a joke about two translators stranded at sea. While Tyrion feigns amusement, Grey Worm tells her that it was the worse joke he had ever heard."[[No One]]" The three friends then celebrate Grey Worm's new-found ability to tell a joke. Shortly after, they hear the sound of bombardment. Looking out the ramparts, they find a massive fleet sent by Astapor, Yunkai, and Pentos bombarding the city with trebuchets. Missandei remarks that the slave cities have returned for their "property." By nightfall, Tyrion admits that his policy of diplomacy was a failure and allows Grey Worm to lead the city's defense. Shortly after, they hear movement on the roof and discover that Daenerys has returned by riding upon [[Drogon]]. The following day, Missandei accompanies Grey Worm, Daenerys, and Tyrion during a meeting with representatives from the slavers' cities who they met during the conference."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  [[Missandei meets with the slave masters during the second siege of Meereen.]] In return for allowing Dany and Tyrion to leave unharmed, Razdal demands the return of the [[Unsullied]] and Missandei, whom he intends to sell as a slave to the highest bidder. However, Dany categorically rejects their offer and unleashes her dragons [[Drogon]], [[Viserion]], and [[Rhaegal]] on the slavers' fleet. The Masters cower in fear as Missandei informs them their queen asks for at least one of their lives as payment for their crimes. Grey Worm executes Belicho and Razdal by slicing their throats, who were quick to offer the death of the [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz|third]] slaver. Yezzan zo Qaggaz is spared so that he can bring back word of Dany's power to the slave cities.  [[Missandei stands by Daenerys's side as they sail for Westeros.]] When Daenerys finally sets sail to Westeros at the head of the combined [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]], [[House Martell|Martell]], Meereenese and [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] armadas (complete with the three Targaryen dragons), Missandei joins her and Tyrion on the deck of the flagship. She stands alongside Varys, looking determined to play her continuous loyal role in the next part of the game of thrones."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  === [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
