= Since the [[Citadel]] only admits men, Sam decides to send Gilly and [[Sam|her baby]] to his family at Horn Hill. While he gets on poorly with his father, he regards his mother and sister as nice."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[The Tarly family has dinner with Gilly.]] Melessa responds just as Sam expected, eagerly greeting him as he arrives. She is also delighted when she sees little Sam, and coos over her "grandchild". At dinner that evening, Melessa notices that Gilly seems unused to cutlery and seems to be copying her when trying to eat. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly, and finally stands up for him, offering the opinion that being the [[Order of Maesters|maester]] to the Night's Watch is an honor. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a [[Free Folk|wildling]], Melessa listens to his rant before finally snapping and giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  When Sam takes Gilly and the baby and escapes in the middle of the night, he tells Gilly that his mother will understand.
