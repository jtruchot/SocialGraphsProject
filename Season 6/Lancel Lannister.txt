= [[Lancel guards the High Sparrow.]] Fervently devoted to the Faith, Lancel and his Militant brothers silently stand beside [[High Sparrow|their leader]] at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] when Jaime, [[Mace Tyrell]] and the Tyrell forces arrive to claim [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] and Loras. Before a battle can break out, the High Sparrow and King Tommen defuse the situation by proudly announcing their new alliance."[[Blood of My Blood]]" [[Lancel demands Cersei's presence.]] Lancel and a detachment of Faith Militant brothers arrive at the Red Keep to collect Cersei for a meeting with the High Sparrow. True to form the disgraced Queen Mother attempts to weasel out accompanying the Faith members to the sept. In response, Brother Lancel commands one of his brothers to take his cousin by force but Cersei "chooses violence" and orders [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] to fight them. The Mountain effortlessly defeats one of the Faith Militant brothers by ripping his head clear from his shoulders. This gruesome act causes the remainder of the Faith Militant (and Lancel first) to flee hastily."[[No One]]"  When Cersei doesn't show up at the Sept of Baelor for her trial, Lancel is sent to retrieve her. On his way, he spots one of [[Qyburn]]'s [[Arthur|little birds]] running towards a door and gives chase. Brother Lancel is lead on a chase through a dank, drafty tunnel but stops when he notices dark shapes. Suddenly, the treacherous child sneaks up behind Lancel and stabs him in the spine, paralyzing the young cleric from the waist down.   [[Lancel attempts to reach the wildfire.]] Falling to the ground in tremendous pain, the young Lannister notices a greenish light emanating from the end of the tunnel and he drags himself toward it. Lancel spots three candles on top of a puddle of wildfire at the end of the tunnel, realizing what is about to happen, he desperately crawls as fast as he can down the dark corridor to the candles. But he doesn't get there in time - he can only watch as the wildfire cache explodes, [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|incinerating him and everyone inside Baelor's Great Sept]]."[[The Winds of Winter]]"
