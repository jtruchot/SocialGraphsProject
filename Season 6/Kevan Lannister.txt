= [[left|Kevan commands the small council.]] Kevan remains as Hand of the King and presides over the small council, which is now composed of Grand Maester Pycelle and Mace and [[Olenna Tyrell]], who insist that they handle the situation of [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] and Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]'s imprisonment. As Pycelle voices complaints against Qyburn and his experimentation on [[Gregor Clegane]], the monster in question arrives with Jaime and Cersei Lannister to everyone's surprise. Both Kevan and Olenna remind Cersei of her place, but Jaime asserts they can stay, since a [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] has always held a position on the council. Cersei chastises her uncle for ignoring [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s untimely death, while Jaime informs him they have much to discuss now that [[Ellaria Sand|Ellaria]] and the [[Sand Snakes]] have seized control of Dorne. Instead, Kevan refuses to talk while Clegane is present and promptly leaves the council chamber, followed by Pycelle and the Tyrells."[[Oathbreaker]]" [[right|Kevan and Olenna listen to Cersei's plan.]] Days later, while discussing the situation with Olenna Tyrell, Kevan is once again approached by Cersei and Jaime. This time, however, Jaime convinces his uncle to keep the Lannister army in reserve when the Tyrell forces arrive to free Margaery and Loras. Despite Cersei's promise to return Lancel, Kevan warns them the Sparrows have many supporters in the city, and many more could die in the coming civil war."[[Book of the Stranger]]" However, the plan fails when Tommen, Margaery and the High Sparrow shockingly reveal a holy alliance of the Crown and the Faith. In the throne room, Kevan stands at Tommen's right hand with a worried look when he strips Jaime of his position in the Kingsguard because "an attack on the Faith is an attack on the Crown", though he will continue to serve Tommen outside King's Landing."[[Blood of My Blood]]"  [[left|Kevan and Pycelle advise King Tommen.]]  Before a sudden royal announcement, Cersei asks why she was not informed of the event, and Kevan responds it was only recently announced. Cersei wishes to stand by her son, but Kevan instead orders her to stand with the other ladies at court, much to her dismay. Kevan witnesses Tommen announce the date for Cersei and Loras's trial and outlaw trial by combat throughout the Seven Kingdoms."[[No One]]" Kevan attends Cersei and Loras's trial in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], standing with Mace Tyrell, but he does not participate. He is killed along with his son Lancel, the High Sparrow, Mace Tyrell, Margaery Tyrell, Loras Tyrell and many King's Landing citizens when the Sept is incinerated with [[wildfire]] by Cersei. He was last seen trying to lead a confused Mace towards the door to escape the sept before the explosion."[[The Winds of Winter]]"
