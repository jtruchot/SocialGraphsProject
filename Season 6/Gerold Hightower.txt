= [[180px|Ser Gerold and Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] make their final stand against the Northmen.]] In [[Bran Stark|Bran Stark's]] vision of the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|events]] at the [[Tower of Joy]], Ser Gerold Hightower fights alongside his fellow Kingsguard, Ser Arthur Dayne, against Eddard Stark, [[Howland Reed]] and four other [[Northmen]]. Before they commence battle, Ser Gerold declares that [[Robert Baratheon]], who he calls "the [[Usurper]]", would have perished instead of Prince Rhaegar at the Trident if he and Arthur had been there. He does not say the same about Ned, even though he fought on the opposing side. Though Ser Gerold manages to kill one of the Northmen, he is slain shortly thereafter by Ned.  [[180x180px|Ser Gerold meets his end at the hands of [[Eddard Stark]].]]  Down in King's Landing, the [[Hand of the King]] [[Kevan Lannister]] objects to his nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] attending a [[small council]] meeting. Jaime counters by stating he has a position there, given he is the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Cersei then asks [[Pycelle]] to vouch for his presence there, and the [[Grand Maester]] brings up the precedent of Gerold being on the Council during Aerys II's reign."[[Oathbreaker]]"
