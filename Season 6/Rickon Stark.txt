 6]]=== [[Rickon and Osha are presented to Ramsay Bolton by Smalljon Umber.]] Rickon and Osha, having reached Last Hearth, are betrayed by [[Smalljon Umber]] after the Greatjon's passing and brought before [[Ramsay Bolton]] in order to form an alliance against Jon Snow and the Wildlings. After seeing Shaggydog's decapitated head as proof of the boy's identity, Ramsay sarcastically welcomes Rickon home, while Rickon shows visible signs of anger at Ramsay and his dead direwolf."[[Oathbreaker]]" Jon and Sansa later receive a [[Bastard Letter|letter]] from Ramsay that says he has Rickon in his dungeon and that his hounds will kill their "wild little brother" if Sansa is not returned. After hearing that Rickon is in danger, Jon and Sansa declare war on Ramsay."[[Book of the Stranger]]" [[In order to lure Jon Snow out, Ramsay uses Rickon as bait.]] Before they commence battle, the three of them have a [[parley]] where Ramsay asks Jon and Sansa if they will let Rickon die because they are too proud to surrender. When Sansa asks for proof that he actually has her brother, Smalljon pulls Shaggydog's head out of a sack and tosses it to the ground in front of them. Ramsay begins to repeat his terms if they wish to save Rickon but Sansa, having firsthand experience of Ramsay's "mercy", cuts him off and declares that he is going to die the next day. [[Rickon is killed by Ramsay.]] As the two armies face each other on the [[Battle of the Bastards|battlefield]], Rickon is brought forward. He lowers his head as Ramsay raises a dagger, but his captor simply cuts the ropes and asks if Rickon likes games. He tells the boy to run to his brother. Rickon begins to walk but looks back to see Ramsay taunting him and starts running. Jon, knowing what Ramsay is plotting, begins riding towards Rickon who keeps running and is nearly hit as arrows land dangerously close. Just as Rickon is about to reach his brother, he is struck by an arrow and killed. This in turn provokes Jon and his army into attacking the Bolton forces while Rickon's body is hit with another volley of arrows.  [[Jon orders his brother's burial.]] Though the battle proves costly to the Stark forces, they ultimately emerge victorious due to the arrival of a [[House Arryn]] cavalry force. Rickon is avenged when Smalljon is killed in battle by [[Tormund]], and Ramsay is viciously beaten to a bloody pulp by Jon before being fed to his own [[Bastard's girls|hounds]] on Sansa's orders. After the battle, his corpse is brought to Winterfell and Jon orders him to be buried in the crypts next to his father."[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
