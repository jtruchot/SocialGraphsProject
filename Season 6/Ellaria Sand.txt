 6]]=== [[Ellaria and Doran discuss Oberyn.]] Ellaria takes a stroll with Doran in the Water Gardens, with Areo Hotah and her daughter Tyene following. As she aids her prince to his seat, they discuss how her paramour Oberyn would have been a terrible ruler, and Doran a terrible adventurer. After Doran tells Tyene what a brilliant woman her mother is, flattering Ellaria, Maester [[Caleotte]] arrives with a message informing him that Myrcella was poisoned.  [[Ellaria betrays and murders Doran Martell.]] As Doran immediately realizes what happened, Tyene stabs and kills Areo, allowing Ellaria to stab Doran in the chest with a concealed knife hidden in her bracelet. Before Doran can strangle her, Ellaria pulls him out of his chair onto the floor while Tyene dispatches Areo and Caleotte. Dissatisfied with Doran's decisions, the other guards simply stand and watch. Ellaria reprimands the Prince for allowing the Lannisters to get away with the deaths of his siblings. Slowly bleeding to death, Doran begs for his son's life. Ellaria refuses, as Trystane Martell's death is also a part of her [[Coup in Dorne|coup]], already having sent Obara and Nymeria to ambush and kill him. She also comments about how he and his son are weak, and that weak men will never rule Dorne ever again."[[The Red Woman]]" [[file:Ellaria sand and the sand snakes game of thrones finale s6.jpg|thumb|Ellaria discusses vengeance with Olenna Tyrell.]] Jaime Lannister later receives word in King's Landing that Ellaria and the Sand Snakes have taken over Dorne and will likely soon declare war on the Lannisters."[[Oathbreaker]]" Following the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]], Ellaria and the Sand Snakes extend an invitation for [[Olenna Tyrell]] to meet them at the Water Gardens. Upon their meeting, Lady Olenna reminds the Sands of the fate of [[Lyonel Tyrell]] when he came to Dorne, prompting Ellaria to assure her that she has nothing to fear from them, even though they practically murdered their own family to seize power in Dorne. [[Ellaria and Varys secure an alliance with Olenna.]] Ellaria insists that they must work together now for survival, as Queen Cersei has declared war on both of them. Olenna objects, saying that survival is not what she is after due to the loss of her [[Mace Tyrell|son]] [[Loras Tyrell|and]] [[Margaery Tyrell|grandchildren]]. Ellaria offers Olenna her heart's desire, which she identifies as "justice and vengeance." She then summons [[Varys]], who further clarifies that he and Ellaria are offering "[[House Targaryen|fire and blood]]", signifying that Ellaria has declared for [[Daenerys Targaryen]] after hearing of her recent alliance with [[Theon Greyjoy]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]].  When Daenerys's assembled armada sails for Westeros some time later, ships of Dorne are seen among them, supplied by Ellaria."[[The Winds of Winter]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
