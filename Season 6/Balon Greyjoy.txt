= [[Balon is informed of the loss of Deepwood Motte.]] Balon and Yara learn that [[Deepwood Motte]], the only remaining ironborn-occupied castle in the North, has been retaken by House Glover, essentially marking the end of their occupation in the North. Balon, however, refuses to relent, and vows to send more troops to take back the Northern lands and castles they have lost, and chides Yara for wasting some of their best men in her failed attempt to rescue Theon from the Boltons, despite Yara reminding Balon that his arrogance cost them the lives of her two older brothers and countless men when he rebelled against Robert Baratheon.  [[180x180px|Balon is thrown into the Sunset Sea.]] Balon then storms out in blinding rain and crosses a bridge separating two towers of Pyke, where he is confronted by his younger brother, Euron, whom he exiled years ago and believed to have died. After a brief exchange, during which Euron makes it clear he intends to murder his brother, Balon brandishes a knife and slashes Euron across the face, but Euron wrestles Balon over the bridge and he falls to his death. [[Balon's funeral.]] Balon's funeral is held the next day and his body is laid to rest in the sea. Yara vows to avenge him, swearing upon the Salt Throne. However, Balon's brother, [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]], reminds Yara that the Salt Throne is not hers to swear upon, as the [[Kingsmoot]] must dictate the [[King of Salt and Rock]], despite the fact that Balon clearly wanted Yara to succeed him."[[Home]]" Although Euron is chosen by the Ironborn to succeed Balon"[[The Door]]", his attachtment to [[Cersei Lannister]] proves to be his downfall"[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]", allowing Yara to retake the Iron Islands in the name of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]."[[The Last of the Starks]]"
