= [[Roose expresses his frustration at Sansa's escape.]] Though Roose congratulates Ramsay for his victory over Stannis Baratheon, he reminds him that they have effectively betrayed the Lannisters by marrying Ramsay to Sansa Stark, who Ramsay allowed to escape. Roose reminds Ramsay that they cannot defend themselves without support from the other Northern houses, who will only do so if they have Sansa, whom Ramsay drove away with his abuse. Ramsay insists that he has men searching for Sansa and Theon, while Roose reminds him that without Sansa, he cannot produce an heir to the North, and subtly warns him that if it comes to be, he will disinherit him in favor of his unborn son with Walda."[[The Red Woman]]"  [[Roose receives Harald Karstark.]] Lord [[Harald Karstark]] later informs the Boltons that the hunting party Ramsay sent to find Sansa and Theon has been massacred. Roose chastises Ramsay for his recklessness and is obviously disgusted at Ramsay's suggestion that they attack Castle Black and kill Jon Snow, who may be sheltering them, since the murder of Ned Stark's final, albeit bastard, son in the Night's Watch will serve as the final straw for the other Houses who despise them for betraying the Starks.   [[Roose is murdered by Ramsay, dying in the same manner as Robb Stark.]] Maester Wolkan soon arrives to announce that Walda has given birth to a boy, unsettling Ramsay. Roose says to Ramsay that he will always be remembered and treated as his firstborn child. Ramsay thanks him for saying that but [[Assassination at Winterfell|fatally stabs]] Roose in the chest, ironically in the same manner in which Roose killed Robb Stark. Ramsay then orders Wolkan to announce that Roose was poisoned by their enemies. Afterwards, he proceeds to have Lady Walda and her [[Bolton (son of Roose)|newborn]] son mauled to death by his [[Bastard's girls|hounds]]."[[Home]]"  Following the death of Roose and his son, Ramsay becomes the new [[Lord of Winterfell]], [[Lord of the Dreadfort]], and [[Warden]] of the [[North]]. Though the official story of Roose's death is that he was poisoned, few in the North believe it: [[Smalljon Umber]] openly, and accurately, accuses Ramsay of murdering Roose, despite Ramsay insisting otherwise. Due to the North's immense hatred for Roose for his role in the Red Wedding, no other families pledge their banners to Ramsay; [[Harald Karstark]] does it only out of revenge against the Starks for [[Execution|executing]] his father, and [[Smalljon Umber|Smalljon]] in order to defend the North against the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] that [[Jon Snow]] let through the [[Wall]] (unaware that it was merely to protect them from the coming [[White Walkers]])."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, Brienne of Tarth, [[Podrick Payne]], [[Eddison Tollett]], and [[Tormund]] Giantsbane all learn of Roose's death in Ramsay's threatening [[Bastard Letter|letter]] to Jon, and Sansa correctly deduces that Ramsay was the culprit."[[Book of the Stranger]]"
