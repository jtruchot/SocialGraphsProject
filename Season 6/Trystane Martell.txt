 6]]=== [[Trystane is killed by Obara during the Dornish coup.]] To ensure Trystane's safety and avoid a conflict with Dorne, Jaime leaves him on board the ship once they reach King's Landing. As Trystane paints the eye stones for Myrcella's funeral, he is approached by Obara and Nymeria, having been sent by Ellaria to kill him, who has herself murdered Doran back in Dorne. Trystane attempts to reason with his cousins that they are family, but they merely laugh it off. He is given a choice to fight Obara or Nymeria. Though he draws his sword and prepares to fight Nymeria, as she is armed with only a whip, he is [[Kinslaying|stabbed]] through the back of the head by Obara and killed instantly, much to Nymeria's annoyance."[[The Red Woman]]"  ===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|
