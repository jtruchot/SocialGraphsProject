= The Three-Eyed Raven monitors Bran as he experiences a vision of Winterfell during the childhood of [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] that reveals [[Hodor]]'s true name, Wylis. He tells Bran that it is time to go, but when Bran expresses a desire to remain in the happy memories, the Three-Eyed Raven pulls him out of the vision. He warns Bran to resist the urge to only view those happy times, and reminds him that as powerful as [[Greensight]] is, the past is still the past, and cannot be changed."[[Home]]"  The Three-Eyed Raven is with Bran when Bran is viewing the events that occurred at the [[Tower of Joy]] at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. He identifies young Ned's second-in-command as [[Howland Reed]], [[Meera Reed|Meera's father]], and also confirms that Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] is a better swordsman than Ned is, explaining to a confused Bran that there is a difference between history and what actually happened.   [[file:The Door 15.jpg|thumb|The Three-Eyed Raven continues to guide Bran.]] Bran calls out to his future father in desperation â€“ to his shock, Ned seems to hear him, but dismisses it and continues into the Tower. The Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the vision, and reprimands him again for trying to interact with the past. The Three-Eyed Raven says he's waited a thousand years for Bran, as the weirwood roots have grown into him. He assures Bran that he [Bran] is not destined to share his fate, but warns that he must learn before he leaves. When Bran demands to know what it is he needs to learn, the Three-Eyed Raven declares, "everything"."[[Oathbreaker]]"  Eventually, he and [[Leaf]] decide that Bran is ready to learn the truth about the [[White Walkers]]. The Three-Eyed Raven accompanies Bran into a vision of the distant past, thousands of years ago, during the [[Wars of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|war]] between the Children and the [[First Men]], in which they witness a group of Children led by Leaf approaching a captured [[Night King|man]], and magically insert a shard of [[Dragonglass]] into his heart, which transforms him into the first of the White Walkers. Awakening, Bran realizes that the White Walkers were created by the Children to use as weapons against his ancestors."[[The Door]]"  Later, whilst the Three-Eyed Raven and Bran's companions are resting, Bran interacts with one of the weirwood roots, triggering a vision in which he witnesses a large army of [[wight]]s, idly standing in the frozen wastes of the [[Lands of Always Winter]]. Wading into their midst, Bran stares incredulously at the creatures, ultimately finding himself standing before the Night King himself, and three of his Lieutenants. Unlike the Wights, however, the Walkers take note of their guest. The Night King meets Bran's gaze, and materializes beside him, seizing his arm. Awakening in terror, the Three-Eyed Raven reveals to him that the Night King has marked him; he knows where he is, and will come for him. The mark likewise neutralizes the magic wards around the cave which bar the Walkers and their minions from entering. The Three-Eyed Raven tells him that he and his companions must leave.  While Meera and Hodor pack their belongings and the children prepare the cave's defenses, the Three-Eyed Raven takes Bran into the past one final time, again to his father's childhood at Winterfell, this time witnessing the young Eddard departing for the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], as the castle's citizens look on, including Wylis and Old Nan. Soon, the Night King and his three Lieutenants arrive with an army of Wights to launch their [[Battle at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|attack]] on the [[Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|cave]]. Though Leaf and the Children attempt to hold them off, their attempts are in vain, as the Walkers and their Wights breach the cave. Still within the vision, the Three-Eyed Raven remains motionless in the roots as the defenders are slaughtered, and Bran, Meera, Hodor, and Leaf make their escape through the back of the cave. [[180x180px|The Three-Eyed Raven turns to dust in Bran's vision, after being killed by the Night King.]] Following their flight, the Night King and his two remaining White Walkers enter the Three-Eyed Raven's chamber, and the Night King slowly approaches him. Within the vision, the Three-Eyed Raven tells Bran that the time has come for him to leave. With that, the Night King swiftly executes him, carving him diagonally across the torso with his [[White Walker ice blade|blade]], as the Three-Eyed Raven breaks apart and turns to dust within the vision, leaving Bran alone.  As Bran and Meera escape from the wight, a hooded [[Benjen Stark]] comes and rescues them. Meera asks Benjen why he rescued them, and he answers the Three-Eyed Raven requested him. Meera says the Three-Eyed Raven is dead, and Benjen responds "He lives again." It is a possibility, regarding this answer, that 'Three-Eyed Raven' wasn't a name as first assumed, but rather a title used by previous greenseers before the present time."[[Blood of My Blood]]"
